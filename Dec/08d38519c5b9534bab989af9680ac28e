In an interview with HuffPost South Africa, Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema expanded on his statement in November outside the Newcastle Magistrate's Court, which shocked many. Malema said: "We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now." But Malema said his statements had been misconstrued and recast them as mere caveats, saying that he does not know what the future may hold. He went on to say white South Africans have overeacted. Malema struck a more conciliatory tone elsewhere in the interview, saying that he couldn't imagine South Africa without white people. "Whites have naturalised in this country. We cannot imagine South Africa without white people. There's no white person who is going to be driven into the sea." He also said white South Africans would also receive land if the EFF was in power, contradicting statements made previously on the subject.
