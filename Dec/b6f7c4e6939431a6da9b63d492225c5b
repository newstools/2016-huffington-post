John Legend and Kanye West may be friends, but that doesn't mean they always see eye to eye, especially when it comes to politics. In case you missed it, West was at Trump Tower in New York City on Tuesday where he met with President-elect Donald Trump. He claimed the meeting was set up so they could discuss "multicultural issues," such as "bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago." The rapper also tweeted: I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change. Legend, however, thinks the "Famous" rapper had a different agenda. In an interview with Clique.tv, which was published online Wednesday, Legend was asked if talking with Trump about important issues was an option for him. "I don't think it's impossible to talk to him about issues," Legend said of the prospect of speaking with the reality-star-turned-politician. "But I won't be used as a publicity stunt and I think Kanye was a publicity stunt." "I'm pretty disappointed with Kanye, that he says he would have voted for Trump," Legend continued. "I think Trump has been corrosive ― his message has been corrosive to the country ― and the things he's promised to do have been very concerning for a lot of people. And for Kanye to support that message is very disappointing." Throughout the election, Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, were very vocal about their political views. Both were proud Hillary Clinton supporters and were never afraid to take Trump to task on Twitter. In an interview with The Daily Beast in August, Legend spoke out against Trump, saying he's "been a public personality forever and that's fine if you want him to be a reality TV host, but if you want him to be president there's a different standard. And remember, his entry into being a Republican was questioning the citizenship of the first black president."
