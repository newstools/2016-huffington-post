Model and TV presenter Shashi Naidoo is typically perfectly groomed and presented, but an adorable throwback video shows a different side to the celebrity. Naidoo posted a video of herself dancing as a child on Instagram on Monday and, as she puts it, she really did dance to her own rhythm. The video shows Naidoo dancing around her parents' home as a young girl with other children. Shashi captioned the image: "Oi. Well, looks like I've always danced to my own rhythm ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ (yep, that's me in the blue)". We like to think it suggests she is a woman who has the confidence to succeed on her own terms. Shashi recently opened The Laser Beautique in Menlyn, Pretoria. Check out the video below: Oi. Well, looks like I've always danced to my own rhythm ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ (yep, that's me in the blue) A video posted by Shashi Naidoo (@shashinaidoo) on Dec 26, 2016 at 12:25am PST
