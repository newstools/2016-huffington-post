Tupac Shakur just earned a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming the sixth hip-hop artist to be inducted, after Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and N.W.A. The organization released the 2017 list Tuesday morning, honoring six inductees. Pearl Jam, in their first year of eligibility, also made the list, as did Joan Baez, a first-time nominee. The institution also announced an Award for Musical Excellence that will be given to guitarist Nile Rodgers. This was Tupac's first year of eligibility to be inducted. In order to be eligible, artists and bands "must have released its first single or album at least 25 years prior to the year of nomination," according to The Hall of Fame's rules. His first single, "Brenda's Got a Baby," debuted in October 1991. The induction ceremony will take place April 7 in Brooklyn.
