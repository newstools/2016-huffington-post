A video of a South African woman slapping a child has gone viral, again highlighting the dangers facing South African children. The video was posted on Youtube on Friday. The woman, who has been blurred from the video, slapped the child at a restaurant which was captured from a cellphone nearby. Child abuse remains a major problem in South Africa. In one of the most representative studies conducted, the Optimus Study released last year, it was found that more than a third (34.4%) of respondents reported having ever been hit, beaten, kicked or physically hurt by an adult who was supposed to be taking care of them.
