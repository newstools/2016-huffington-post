Justin Bieber, who is set to tour South Africa in May 2017, went out to dinner in LA wearing a faux fur blanket and was basically all of us at our most hungover. Except we're not Justin Bieber, so we don't have swarms of paparazzi and a social media mob just waiting to rip into our questionable fashion choices (thank God). After Bieber was snapped in his soft, cozy blanket cocoon, Twitter had a field day. Not because it's wildly socially unacceptable to wear a bed throw to a fancy restaurant... but because they thought Bieber looked like a grilled chicken breast. A grilled piece of chicken. I see no difference. Lol pic.twitter.com/EHQCo0THr6 my first thought was "did the photoshop chicken onto Justin Bieber?" https://t.co/sNFxRfw1cR Justin Bieber normalizing the trend of wearing a blanket in public is a cause I can 100% support
