Justin Bieber, who is set to tour South Africa in May 2017, went out to dinner in LA wearing a faux fur blanket and was basically all of us at our most hungover. Except we're not Justin Bieber, so we don't have swarms of paparazzi and a social media mob just waiting to rip into our questionable fashion choices (thank God). After Bieber was snapped in his soft, cozy blanket cocoon, Twitter had a field day. Not because it's wildly socially unacceptable to wear a bed throw to a fancy restaurant... but because they thought Bieber looked like a grilled chicken breast. why does Justin Bieber look like a chicken patty pic.twitter.com/FTKEn5pqRT A grilled piece of chicken.
