Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is a man deeply in love with his wife Mantwa and not afraid to publicly declare that love. He posted a beautiful Instagram picture of his wife resting her head on his lap with a beaming smile. "Sharing my life with my amazing wife is a beautiful experience. Her support is unqualified and unconditional. Allow us to just pause and celebrate lovee, it's a good thing... It's been two years since we said 'I do'. #2ndAnniversary," he posted.
