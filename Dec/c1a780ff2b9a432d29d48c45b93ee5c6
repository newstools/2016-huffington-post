Well, we all know what Donald Trump is up to on Saturday nights. For weeks, each “Saturday Night Live” episode has been followed by an especially curmudgeonly review from the show’s No. 1 fan/hate-watcher, our new president-elect. In that time, HuffPost asked some “SNL” cast members for their thoughts, and Sasheer Zamata summed it up best, saying, “Shouldn’t he be working on something?” Hey, yeah. Shouldn’t he be working on something? While Trump called in to “Today” after his appointment as Time’s Person of the Year, Matt Lauer, who some believe failed to press Trump in a previous TV segment, called the Donald out on his Twitter behavior. “Can we agree, President-elect Trump, that at this stage it would be better for you to simply stop watching ‘SNL’ as opposed to watching it and then complaining about it? ” said Lauer. The answer? Basically a resounding, “Nah.” WATCH: “I like Alec, but his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good." @realdonaldtrump on #SNL https://t.co/NEslxLZJuS Trump went on a rant, saying, ”Well, I hosted ‘SNL’ when it was a good show, but it’s not a good show anymore. First of all, nothing to do with me. There’s nothing funny about it. The skits are terrible. I mean Alec, I like Alec, but his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good. I don’t think it’s good. And I do like him. And I like him as an actor, but I don’t think that his imitation of me gets me at all. And it’s meant to be very mean-spirited, which is very biased, and I don’t like it. So I can tweet that out.” “But you can’t bring yourself to stop watching it,” said Lauer. “No, look, frankly the way the show is going now, and you look at the kind of work they’re doing, who knows how long that show’s gonna be on. It’s a terrible show.” “I think it’s gonna do OK,” Lauer said. Yeah, “SNL” is probably going to be fine. After all, Time’s Person of the Year tunes in every week. Share this slide:
