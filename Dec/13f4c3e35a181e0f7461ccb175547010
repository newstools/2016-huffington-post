Just change the channel already. President-elect Donald Trump has once again tweeted how angry he is about Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of him on “Saturday Night Live.” Following this weekend’s episode, Trump didn’t waste any time in blasting the show as “unwatchable,” “totally biased” and “not funny” ― while saying Baldwin’s impersonation “just can’t get any worse.” Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad Here’s how the clearly thicker-skinned Baldwin replied: ...@realDonaldTrump Release your tax returns and I'll stop.Ha This week’s cold-open skit centered around the Trump character retweeting random people, including a high school student, during what should have been an important security briefing. “There is a reason actually that Donald tweets so much,” said Kate McKinnon, who was playing Trump campaign manager and top aide Kellyanne Conway. “He does it to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his Cabinet.” To which Baldwin-as-Trump replied: “Actually, that’s not why I do it. I do it because my brain is bad.” Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon even made an appearance, as the Grim Reaper. In November, Trump petulantly dubbed the show “totally one-sided” and “biased.” The previous month, while he was still on the campaign trail, he said it was “boring and unfunny” and called for it to be scrapped ― conveniently forgetting he actually hosted the show in November 2015.
