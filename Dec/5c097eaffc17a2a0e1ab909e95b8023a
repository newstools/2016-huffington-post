WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview airing Sunday that it is “ridiculous” to believe that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf. The Washington Post reported on Friday that the CIA and other intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government took action to favor the Trump campaign, but Trump said he doesn’t believe it. “I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it. I don’t know why and I think it’s just ― you know, they talked about all sorts of things. Every week it’s another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,” Trump said on “Fox News Sunday.” (As FactCheck.org noted, Trump’s victory was “hardly a landslide by historic comparison.”) “They have no idea if it’s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. I mean, they have no idea,” Trump said. Trump added that he doesn’t believe that the CIA put out the story in The Washington Post. “I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And frankly, I think they’re putting it out,” Trump said. “And it’s ridiculous.” Senators from both parties said Sunday that the Americans should be alarmed by reports of Russian interference in the election, and that it should not become a partisan issue. “It’s clear the Russians interfered,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that’s the subject of investigation. But the facts are stubborn things: they did hack into this campaign.” McCain said the hacks had some effect on the election. “Every week or so there was new information,” McCain said, referring to the publication of stolen DNC and Clinton campaign emails.
