Two girls captured on video assaulting fellow pupils at LÃ¼ckhoff High School in Idas Valley, Stellenbosch, have been recommended for expulsion, the Western Cape Education Department said on Thursday. The school governing body made the recommendation following a disciplinary hearing attended by both girls on Wednesday, department spokesperson Jessica Shelver said. "It must be noted that it is only the head of a provincial education department who is afforded the power by law to expel a learner," she said. In the first case, a video of a pupil attacking another at the school on November 24 went viral on social media at the weekend. The girl, 15, appeared in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court on Wednesday on a charge of assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The case was postponed to January 25 and transferred to the Child Justice Court for consultation and representations. On Tuesday, a second video surfaced of another girl assaulting a fellow pupil at the same school.
