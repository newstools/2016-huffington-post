Johannesburg businessman Hugh Glenister has approached the court to force the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams to prosecute eight police officers who ransacked his property without a search warrant. The incident happened on July 8, 2015 when the eight officers climbed over the wall of his home and ransacked the property causing extensive damage. At the time, police said they had received a tip-off from Crime Intelligence that there were drugs on the property and therefore they did not need a search warrant. No drugs were found on the property. Glenister laid charges of malicious damage to property against the eight SAPS members. He has that said more than 18 months later nothing has happened with the matter. "There has been communication with my attorney about a meeting but it kept being postponed. They always have excuses," said Glenister. He has launched an application against the Minister of Police, Nathi Nhleko, and the NDPP to direct the NDPP to make a decision either to proceed with the prosecution against the eight police officers, or to issue a decision not to prosecute so that Glenister can initiate a private prosecution. "This case is not so much about the extensive damage caused by the SAPS during their search, but more so the total disregard for the rule of law. It is about holding people accountable to the law," he said.
