In another segment from the show, which was uploaded by a YouTube user on Monday, Obama spoke about the hacking of Democratic and Republican National Committee emails and the impact it had on the outcome of the recent U.S. presidential election. The episode will be broadcast on Comedy Central (DSTv channel 122) at 9pm on Tuesday, 13 December 2016.
