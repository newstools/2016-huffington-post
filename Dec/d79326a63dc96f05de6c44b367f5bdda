A flashy new video featuring landmarks from around the city of Johannesburg has taken off on Facebook. You'd be mistaken for thinking that this gorgeous eye-candy is a local production but sadly, it is not. The video, for the song "Makeba" by French artist JAIN was directed by Greg Dewey and Lionel Hirle and is part of a design project by Art Bridge, a Paris-based organisation that produces "artistic collaborations for visionary branded content". The video features local artists, dancers and landmarks. Overhead electrical lines, tarred roads and Joburg highrises undulate with the baseline and a ripple runs skywards through Ponte Towers. Knowing that the video is not locally made takes some of the shine off, but with its beautiful design elements and featuring of local landmarks, it's still worth a look. The tune is catchy too.
