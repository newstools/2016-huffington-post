So, according to the Western Cape Education Department, a circular from the Department of Basic Education instructs a reduction of the pass mark for maths for Grades 7 to 9, to just 20 percent. Apparently it only covers pupils who have previously obtained at least 40 percent in the subject, and are passing all their other subjects. It's supposed to be a bit of a boost for those who are struggling since maths became a compulsory subject. Still, 20 percent? The pass mark for maths is 20%.

8+8= - 3.97857
16+16=32

Is a pass.  'nuff said. Watch Chester Missing saying nice, totally uncontroversial things at the Huffington Post SA launch party.
