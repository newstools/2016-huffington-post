Steve Martin's tribute to the late Carrie Fisher did not sit well with some. The actor tweeted about Fisher following news that the "Star Wars" actress died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles last week. New York Magazine noted that Martin's tweet focused on her physicality, rather than her talents or her impact. According to Us Weekly, one user on Twitter replied: "I think she apprised to be something higher than just being pretty. How do you want to be remembered?" The actor ultimately deleted the tweet following the backlash. Remember Carrie Fisher for her talent, her feminism, her commentary on mental health — not for the way she looked https://t.co/R3eZqy6Ooh While some thought criticism of Martin was unjustified, others said Fisher ― a staunch feminist who spoke out against the objectification of women throughout her career ― wouldn't have paid any mind to the "whiny dudes" getting mad over the clap-backs. I think Carrie Fisher would have enjoyed laughing at the whiny dudes getting mad about @landsbaumshell's good take. https://t.co/oLox5trwjO A rep for Martin was not immediately available for further comment.
