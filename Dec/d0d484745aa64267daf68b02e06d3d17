Beyoncé is a Christmas queen. The singer on Saturday shared a series of images on Instagram to show off her impressive holiday decorations. One shot shows Bey, dressed in a short dark purple dress, in front of a massive tree covered in silver and purple decorations. In other shots, she poses in front of her signature gray-white wall wearing a pair of mini antlers. There also appears to be a cute pink tree, perhaps for her daughter Blue Ivy, and a "Lemonade"-themed tree, complete with sparkly lemon ornaments.
