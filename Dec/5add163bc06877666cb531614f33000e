There are plenty of reasons why Ryan Gosling has become the Internet's collective boyfriend: 1. He lives up to his Feminist Ryan Gosling mystique and really wants a woman to be POTUS as soon as possible. 2. He can tap and waltz like a freaking modern-day Fred Astaire. 3. He's a doting dad to two daughters and is clearly in love with Eva Mendes. (He's said that he "lives with angels." D'aww.) 4. He looks like this: We could go on. But if you were to ask Gosling himself, he'd tell you he's prime boyfriend material for one reason: "My Canadianness." "I think it's part of, um, America just finally realizing that there's a place called Canada," the 36-actor said when asked about his appeal in GQ's January issue. "That it's nearby. And the people there are, you know, different but the same. And not just America's hat. We have free health care, education." The actor goes onto say that he's not that special, citing the Internet's other imaginary boyfriend, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, as an example of Canada just being hot right now. "It's the only thing that makes any goddamn sense. I mean, look at Trudeau," Gosling tells GQ. "He's doing a lot of things, but things that are kind of natural parts of being Canadian. I don't think Canada is as shocked by what Trudeau is doing as the rest of the world is." Elsewhere in the profile, Gosling talks about how great family life is with Mendes and the couple's two young daughters, Esmeralda and Amada. "I only know what it's like to have my kids. And in my situation, Eva's the dream mother, and they're dream babies, and it's like a dream that I'm having right now. I'm dreaming it all. So I feel so lucky." And we're lucky, too, Ryan, to have you as our no. 1 celebrity bae.
