Zimbabwean opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) secretary-general, Douglas Mwonzora has said that party leader Morgan Tsvangirai's ill health "is no cause for concern". Tsvangirai disclosed in June that he had cancer of the colon. He has been getting chemo treatment in South Africa. Speaking during an interview with News24, Mwonzora said Tsvangirai was responding well to treatment. "His health is no cause for concern at all. He has been receiving treatment in South Africa since June and is responding well to the treatment," Mwonzora. He said that the MDC leader was ready for the 2018 presidential election campaign. "His illness will have no impact on his ability to campaign for 2018 elections. Many leaders across the world have ruled with an illness and still succeeded. We are aware of the concern but he will be fit for the campaign and the office," Mwonzora said. Tsvangirai on Saturday addressed what was termed a "shutdown" rally in Harare, which was attended by thousands of his supporters. This was his first public appearance after a lengthy absence. He told his supporters that he was not prepared to form another government of national unity (GNU) with President Robert Mugabe, as the country's economy continued to shrink. "Some people are talking about forming a second GNU; No. I am not going to be part of another GNU; what we want as th eMDC are electoral reforms before the 2018 elections so that we hold elections that do not breed a predetermined outcome," said Tsvangirai.
