This January we’re launching Gym Buddies, an online fitness community to help make lasting changes towards a healthier lifestyle. Whatever your fitness level - complete beginner or seasoned pro looking for a new challenge - we’ve got something for you. For daily fitness motivation straight to your inbox, sign up to our newsletter here. Motivating yourself to go to the gym can be hard at the best of times, but it’s especially tough when you’ve been sat on your arse drinking wine and eating pigs-in-blankets for a month. That’s why we believe it’s essential to get yourself a workout buddy. Whether it’s a real-life friend or someone you met in the gym, your pal can help you get fit and, most importantly, stay fit. Here are 15 reasons that exercising with a friend is better than going it alone. You’re not just letting yourself down, you’re letting THEM down. They’ll be watching. Or drinking wine. Where do I put my foot again?  A little to the left.  I mean, they cost an arm and a leg. Which they more than likely will be. Because your BFF looks stupid, too. Laughter is good for the core, right? Unless they pick someone else. Just keep it clean. Just... one... more... rep.  Because sharing is caring. Nutritious and delicious. This is not what I normally look like, OK? Share this slide:
