As long as they abide by the laws of the republic and help to create jobs, we will work with them, North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo said when asked about the controversial Gupta family last Friday. The family has faced allegations of impropriety due to their close links to President Jacob Zuma. ​​​Huffington Post South Africa reported last week that the Guptas may be involved in money laundering. But Mahumapelo has said that the family's rights to conduct business in South Africa should be protected and that he will review his relationship with the Guptas only after the family has been found guilty of some wrongdoing. "It's unfair to judge people by association," said Mahumapelo. News24.
