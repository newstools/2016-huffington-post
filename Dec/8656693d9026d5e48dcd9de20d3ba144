CCTV footage has emerged showing acting national police commissioner Lieutenant General Kgomotso Phahlane fighting off two interlopers and then taking cover behind a couch. In the video, he could be seen confronting the two gun-wielding men and chasing them out of the premises of the Ayothaya Thai Spa in Dunkeld earlier in the year. In his bid to protect his wife and the spa employee, Phahlane lost his balance and fell as the men bolted out of the building. While they were leaving, the camera seems to show one of them firing a shot in the direction of the top cop. Phahlane scrambles on the floor to safety. While he was being helped up by the two women, one of the robbers returns with the gun pointed at Phahlane, who then seeks refuge behind a couch. While the intruder is focusing on Phahlane, the second trespasser comes in and the women retaliate by pushing the two men out with a couch. The two assumed would-be robbers then fled the scene. The incident happened in June, and at that time Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said Phahlane was out waiting for his wife when he stopped the crime. News24 reported that Phahlane's spokesperson Brigadier Mashadi Selepe responded to questions posed to her regarding the incident and said there was no dispute on the sequence of events that unfolded on the day of the attack at the spa. "It is unfortunate that you are suggesting a misrepresentation of facts which will be found nowhere in the department's reporting on the matter. It is found suspicious or why you are in possession of such recordings which is a subject of investigation [sic]? Such recordings can under no circumstances be made public," she said.
