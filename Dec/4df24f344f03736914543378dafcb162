A couple who are tired of friends asking when they're going to have a baby found a hilarious way to shut them up. The pair, who've been married for three years, teased pals by pretending they had a little one on the way. In a fake pregnancy shoot, the wife appeared with a bulging tummy. But in fact, the only new addition to their family has been an adorable puppy named Leelu. "My husband and I have been married three years and everyone is bugging us about having a baby," she wrote on Imgur. "Close enough right?"
