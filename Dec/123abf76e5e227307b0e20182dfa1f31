Kevin Hedderwick, CEO of Famous Brands, was placed as the 11th richest person in South Africa on the Business Times Rich List. But it seems he's not that rich â€” nor even rich enough to be in the top 100 of the list. And the company is not impressed. On Monday, Famous Brands sent a statement requesting an apology and correction, saying the error had caused Hedderwick "significant distress and embarrassment and reflects negatively on the remuneration policies and practices of the group". The list had Hedderwick earning R45,991 million in 2015. Famous Brands said it should actually read as "R4.591m, as reflected in the group's annual financial statements published on 19 June 2015". The person in the number 100 position, Yunis Shaik, reportedly earns R14,794 million. "Given the potentially damaging impact of this error on the group's reputation, the board would like to advise stakeholders that a letter has been submitted to the editor of the Business Times requesting the publication to issue an apology and correction in this regard," the statement read. Who Owns Whom compiler Andrew McGregor told Fin24 that they are looking into the matter, while the Business Times editor, Ron Derby, said the error was fixed online.
