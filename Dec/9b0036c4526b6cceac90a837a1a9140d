Following Brian Molefe's fall from grace and his resignation as Eskom's boss, the board of the utility has now appointed Matshela Koko as acting CEO. Koko has been with Eskom for many years and was Eskom's Group Executive for Generation. Koko is not without little skeletons in his closet. 1). In his previous position, he signed a document approving a prepayment of almost R600 million to Gupta-owned Tegeta. The amount is said to have enabled the company to purchase Optimum Coal. The company was fingered in former public protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. 2). Before the release of that report, he was interviewed on Carte Blanche and was asked about the prepayment. Koko lied on air about his having anything to do with it. He denied having played a role â€” only when shown a document with his signature he changed his story and said he made a mistake. 3). Koko is very much pro-nuclear. He does not believe in renewable energy but is willing to see Eskom pay R150 billion over 10 years. He claimed the power utility could pay for the programme from its cash reserves. 4). The Constitutional Court is set to deliver a judgment relating to a R5 billion contract for steam generators at the Koeberg nuclear power plant. Koko allegedly intervened to ensure the contract was awarded to Areva. The company got the deal even though Eskom's technical and executive teams recommended to award the contract to Westinghouse. Despite all the challenges Koko faces, energy expert Chris Yelland has called on society to give the new boss a chance and to judge him based on his work. He said it was true that Koko has the experience and has managed to climb through the ranks of the organisation. "He has made pronouncements, he is pro-nuclear and skeptical about renewable energy. I don't think we should judge people by what is spoken and said about them. Actions speak louder than words," Yelland said.
