We asked Jarred Doyle, publicist to some of our favourite celebrities, what his clients want for Christmas, and it seems love was the wish of the year, among one or two more earthly yearnings. Here's their wishlist. Maps Maponyane -- ''I just want to be surrounded by the people I love.'' There's no doubt that Maponyane is adored by his fans. But this year, all he wants is to be in the company of those who love him most. Liesl Laurie -- ''My family's continued support, affection and love.'' The former Miss South Africa loves her heels, saying she would love to receive a new pair of Jimmy Choo heels, but she knows that family is the most important thing in her life. Danilo Acquisto -- ''I really love when people around me are happy.'' TV presenter on Afternoon Express and a radio presenter on Good Hope FM Acquisto already drives a Mercedes Benz, but would not mind an upgrade. ''A New C63AMG Coupe would be fantastic." But this Christmas, his ultimate wish is to be surrounded by people he loves. Ayanda Thabethe -- ''Lots of love.'' All BET Africa presenter and actor Thabethe wishes for Christmas is ''lots of love'' for all those in her family. Nothing more, Ayanda? Chanley Wong -- "A family trip, literally anywhere, just so we're all able to be together." The TV presenter and 2016 SA Film And TV Awards nominee has travel on her mind this Christmas and would like to take her family on all her adventures. ''I would love a ticket to Spain, America, England and Thailand." Jarred Doyle is a publicist working in the SA entertainment industry. The above are some of his clients.
