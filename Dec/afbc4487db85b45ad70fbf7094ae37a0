A goal from a goalkeeper in a soccer match is about as rare as a chicken with teeth. A spectacular overhead kick in the dying minutes of a match to rescue a point is simply the stuff of feverish wet dreams when you've accidentally taken too much cough syrup.  A goalkeeper in South Africa has equalised for his side with a last-minute bicycle kick üëèpic.twitter.com/IDDvEusrs6 With Baroka FC trailing 1 ‚Äî 0 to Orlando Pirates in the dying moments of the Premier Soccer League game, goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke charged forward into the opposing box for a corner. These are the tactics of desperation. Just throw all the bodies into the box and hope for the best. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate @Baroka_FC goalkeeper Masuluke Oscarine for his spectacular performance last night.  As the ball was lofted in, the Pirates keeper punched it out ‚Äî and in the general direction of Masuluke. With his back to goal, he simply threw himself backward, and smashed the ball over his head and into the net. Itumeleng Khune has congratulated fellow goalkeeper Masuluke Oscarine on his wonder goal for @Baroka_FC last night. https://t.co/jrsKQyrKYL  Masuluke took off in a super celebration that is maybe even better than the goal he just scored. Wouldn't you, when you've just cemented your place in the football canon with a goal so utterly ridiculous that you wouldn't dare try it on FIFA17? That goal from the Baroka goalkeeper is the greatest thing in the history of things. Eat your heart out, Peter Schmeichel!
