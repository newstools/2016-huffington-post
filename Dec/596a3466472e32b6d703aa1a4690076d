  John Legend didn't need to be present for Chrissy Teigen to get an adorable family photo. The 31-year-old model's husband is currently traveling, so she had someone fill in for him when she took their daughter, Luna, to meet Santa for the first time. "When your husband is in Paris but you gotta get your Santa on," she wrote as the caption for a very funny photo she posted to Twitter. And, of course, people loved her ingenuity. Including Legend himself. Luna, however, did not seem to be fooled by her mother's game. The cuteness doesn't end there, either. Teigen posted a few more choice photos of Luna on Twitter and Instagram that will make you light up like a Christmas tree: I love the holidays A photo posted by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Dec 14, 2016 at 1:09pm PST All we want for Christmas is more of this, please.
