#DiamondInAfrica 🆖💎🌍🆖 A photo posted by Da L.E.S (@2freshles) on Dec 8, 2016 at 3:10pm PST  Hip-hop artist Da L.E.S surprised fans on Thursday night with the digital release of his new album, "Diamond in Africa". It is the fourth studio album from the rapper, whose real name is Leslie Jonathan Mampe, following the release of "North God" in November 2015. Despite unexpectedly dropping the album at midnight, it wasn't long before fans were downloading the album.   @2freshLES finally!!!! It's out!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   "I feel like I've evolved; trying new frequencies within the music, trying new ways within my sound," Da L.E.S told DJ Fresh on Friday on his 5fm morning show, Fresh At Five. "I just felt like I'm THE diamond in Africa and I made the one song 'Diamond in Africa' and from that song I just felt like I was going to name the album 'Diamond in Africa," he said describing the album's sound as more polished and mature. The North God attributed his work ethic and high output — he has produced an album a year for the last three years — to becoming a dad to daughter Maddie, who recently celebrated her third birthday.

Before I had my daughter, I was more of a day-by-day, nonchalant kind of a guy. Now it's 10 years in the game next year for me, I'm just reevaluating my brand and looking at so many other great music business opportunities to create and just better myself."
