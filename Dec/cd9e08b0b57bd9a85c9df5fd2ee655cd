Gauteng Hawks boss Major General Prince Mokotedi has laid several charges, including treason and conspiracy to commit murder, against Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert McBride, former Gauteng Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya, private investigator Paul O'Sullivan and a crime intelligence officer, Captain Candice Coetzee, at the Bedfordview police station. According to the Mail & Guardian, Mokotedi brought nine charges against the group on Monday, including treason, espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, corruption, intimidation and harassment, defeating the ends of justice, tax evasion and a contravention of the immigration laws. The paper reports that Mokotedi claims the group conspired to murder him and Hawks boss Lieutenant General Mthandazo Berning Ntlemeza, to use information gathered on the president's son, Duduzane Zuma, to "mobilise the community to revolt and pressure the president to quit office," to mobilise for an 'Arab Spring' type of revolt in the country, and to "destabilise the security forces of the country and oust the president of the country through popular revolt".
