We're into the last few weeks of 2016 and Papa Penny Penny fans are thrilled to ring in the new year after the Tsonga performer announced the debut of his reality show in January. And as soon as the announcement was made, fans elatedly took to Twitter. The 'Yogo Yogo' hit maker took to his Instagram account on Sunday where he posted a picture of himself with his wife and daughter in matching outfits with the caption: "Good people now is the time to watch my TV program reality show on 2017 January 11 Mzansi channel 161 called Penny Penny Ahee." Known for his eclectic hairstyles, outfits, and drama — like his claim that he was Cassper Nyovest's father — "Penny Penny Ahee" should have audiences glued to their screens.
