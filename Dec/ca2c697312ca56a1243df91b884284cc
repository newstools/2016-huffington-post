Parliament's ad hoc committee looking into the fitness of the South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) board will begin interviewing witnesses on Wednesday. The ad hoc committee's work stalled last week after the last remaining board member, Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe, took the committee to court citing alleged "bias" from opposition MPs. Judge Siraj Desai dismissed Maguvhe's application in the Western Cape High Court on Friday, saying he would give reasons at a later state. The first batch of witnesses to be interviewed includes Auditor General Kimi Makwetu, a representative from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and representatives from the office of the public protector, committee chairperson Vincent Smith said on Friday. Other witnesses to be called thereafter include Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi, the SABC 8, acting SABC political editor Sophie Mokoena and former board members and employees. The committee will sit from 9am each day for 11 days. The hearings will break on December 15 and restart for one week on January 10. The committee will consider a draft report on January 24 and present a final report on February 15. News24
