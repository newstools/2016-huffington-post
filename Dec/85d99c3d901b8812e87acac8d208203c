  Lady Gaga revealed in a "Today" segment that aired Monday that she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, almost exactly two years after she opened up about being raped at the age of 19. "I suffer from a mental illness — I suffer from PTSD. I've never told anyone that before, so here we are," the singer said. "But the kindness that's been shown to me by doctors — as well as my family and my friends — it's really saved my life." she added. "I've been searching for ways to heal myself, and I've found that kindness is the best way." The 30-year-old singer spoke to "Today" as part of the Share Kindness campaign, a partnership of Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and Today and NBC Universal. For the segment, Gaga visited the Ali Forney Center in Brooklyn, New York, where she spoke with homeless LGBTQ youth. "These children are not just homeless or in need. Many of them are trauma survivors. They've been rejected in some type of way," she said. "I am no better than any of those kids. And I'm no worse than any of them," she added. "We are equal. We both walk our two feet on the same earth. And we're in this together." Gaga first revealed in a 2014 interview with "The Horward Stern Show" that she had been raped as a teenager. At the time, she said she had waited to open up about the rape because she did not want it to "define" her. Need help?
