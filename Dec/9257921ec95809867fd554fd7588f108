South Africans were more interested in Pokemon Go than Donald Trump, if our Google searches for the year are anything to go by. Search giant Google on Wednesday released its lists of the top searches in South Africa in 2016. Google also announced the top 10 "What is" and "How to" questions for the year. "This year's overall trending searches from South Africa have a decidedly global feel," Google noted in the release. "Where last year's top searches -- loadshedding and xenophobia -- were distinctly local issues, this year's top searches show South African eyes are turned to the world at large, not just at home." Predictably, Jacob Zuma and Public Protector topped the top trending South African politicians and prominent figures list. Mandoza and Gugu Zulu, both of whom passed away this year, topped the top trending South African celebrities lists. 1. Pokemon Go 2. Euro 2016 3. Olympic Games Rio 2016 4. Donald Trump 5.
