A viral clip of an Australian hunter punching a kangaroo in the face isn't just another animal video. There's a lot more to it. The video, which shows a man saving his dog from a kangaroo, was shot in June when a group of friends went on a hunting trip to fulfill a dying man's last wish. The trip was for a 19-year-old man named Kailem who wanted to catch a boar, according to News.com.au. Kailem had a rare form of bone cancer, and died last week.  "A few of us got together to take him out, and another mate filmed more than an hour of video to put together as a DVD for Kailem and his family of the trip," Matthew Amor, who organized the trip, said. The viral clip is from that DVD, although the man in the video is another member of their group named Greig Tonkins, and not Kailem. Regardless, Amor says his friend would have loved the attention the video is receiving. â€œKailem would be looking down from up there [heaven] and laughing because it was the highlight of the trip."
