Former ANC Northern Cape chairperson John Block and businessman Christo Scholtz were on Tuesday sentenced to an effective 15 years in jail for money laundering and corruption. Block, once regarded as the most powerful man in the Northern Cape, also received a confiscation order of R2 million for his assets while Scholtz received one for R53 million. They were involved in leasing office space to the Northern Cape Social Development Department at inflated prices. Scholtz was a director in Trifecta Holdings, which secured the tenders for the leases. The department rented Trifecta's buildings in Kimberley, Upington and Springbok. News 24
