A man shot and killed himself to avoid being arrested after he was found drinking in public. Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said officers were running an operation in the township of Mamelodi, in eastern Tshwane, targeting people who drink and drive and people drinking in public. "At around 2pm the officers spotted four men sitting under a tree drinking. They approached them but the men fled in different directions. The officers went after them and managed to catch three of them. When they approached the fourth man, he took out a firearm and fired about four shots at the officers," said Mahamba. The officers called for backup and members of the public joined the chase. The man was cornered and reportedly turned the gun on himself. "He then pointed the firearm at his head and shot himself. He died on the spot. The TMPD officers and members of the public were not injured during the incident. A case of suicide has been opened and will be investigated further," said Mahamba. It was still not known why he shot himself. The matter will be investigated and ballistic tests will be conducted on the gun.
