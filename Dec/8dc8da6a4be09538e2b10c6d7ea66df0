J.K. Rowling delivered a heartfelt Christmas message of hope via Twitter on Saturday. The Harry Potter series author posted 12 tweets offering encouragement to people who are “going through tough times” over the holiday season that may be worsened by “images of perfect lives, which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold.” Rowling promised “extraordinary transformations are possible” and “nothing is forever,” before urging people to remember Christmas Day itself was “in the end, just a day.” “It isn’t a test or a scorecard of you or your life, so be kind to yourself,” she added.

I was truly afraid of the future. 7/12 You never know what the future holds. Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute. 8/12 So if you’re sad, or lonely, or bereaved, or ill, separated from your loved ones or in any other way suffering this Christmas, 9/12 I send you love and wish you luck and better times. Millions of us have been where you are now. 10/12 Remember, Christmas Day is, in the end, just a day. It isn’t a test or a scorecard of you or your life, so be kind to yourself ❤️ 11/12 ❄️☃️✨🎄 Merry Christmas! 🎄✨☃️❄️
