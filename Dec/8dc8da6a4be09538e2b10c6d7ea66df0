J.K. Rowling delivered a heartfelt Christmas message of hope via Twitter on Saturday. The Harry Potter series author posted 12 tweets offering encouragement to people who are “going through tough times” over the holiday season that may be worsened by “images of perfect lives, which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold.” Rowling promised “extraordinary transformations are possible” and “nothing is forever,” before urging people to remember Christmas Day itself was “in the end, just a day.” “It isn’t a test or a scorecard of you or your life, so be kind to yourself,” she added. Read her inspiring tweets in full below: I’ve had so many lovely messages wishing me a merry Christmas. Thank you! 1/12 I’ve also heard from people who are going through very tough times. These always seem worse at Christmas. 2/12 At this time of year, we’re bombarded with images of perfect lives, which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold. 3/12 If you’re lucky enough to be with the people you love, warm and safe, with enough to eat, I’m sure you feel as blessed as I do. 4/12 But if your life is currently full of difficulties; if you aren’t where you want to be, either literally or figuratively, 5/12 remember that extraordinary transformations are possible. Everything changes. Nothing is forever. 6/12 Thinking back to my worst Christmas, I found it hard to believe that my unhappiness would pass. I was truly afraid of the future. 7/12 You never know what the future holds. Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute. 8/12 So if you’re sad, or lonely, or bereaved, or ill, separated from your loved ones or in any other way suffering this Christmas, 9/12 I send you love and wish you luck and better times. Millions of us have been where you are now. 10/12 Remember, Christmas Day is, in the end, just a day. It isn’t a test or a scorecard of you or your life, so be kind to yourself ❤️ 11/12 ❄️☃️✨🎄 Merry Christmas! 🎄✨☃️❄️
