We can't wait for them to be available in South Africa - we're keeping an eye out and will be sure to keep you updated. That the brand is becoming more inclusive and casting an array of gorgeous women to model its clothing is obviously great. But we're also excited about the fact that the clothing available in larger sizes is actually super cute. There are printed leggings, matching long-sleeved cover-ups and racer back tanks. Far too often we've seen brands sacrifice style for size, further perpetuating the stereotype that women over a certain size don't care about fashion or, in this case, fashionable fitness. Bravo to Nike for yet again breaking down that barrier. To all the other fitness brands out there who might be considering expanding their offerings: Just do it.
