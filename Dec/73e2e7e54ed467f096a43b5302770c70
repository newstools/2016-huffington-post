Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is currently studying the court papers filed by President Jacob Zuma to review the state of capture report as well as to have it set aside. Her office has confirmed to The Huffington Post South Africa that she has received the documents. Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe said the papers were received on Monday morning. "The public protector is still studying them. She will meet with her office's legal representatives and map a way forward," said Segalwe. In his challenge to the report, Zuma said it was not the public protector's role to get involved in the environment of the executive. Former public protector Thuli Madonsela recommended that Zuma institute a judicial inquiry and Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should appoint the judge to lead the commission. Zuma's decision to challenge the report was met with condemnation from various political parties including the Economic Freedom Fighters, Congress of the People and the Democratic Alliance (DA), who all viewed the move as a delay tactic. The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal welcomed Zuma's decision to challenge the report, claiming that Madonsela was fixated on a witch-hunt against the president. Provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabela said if Zuma was to adhere to the remedial actions, it would constitute spitting in the face of the Constitution, which speaks of the separation of powers. "The Constitution makes it clear that the president is the one who is supposed to initiate a judicial inquiry. When [Madonsela] says the chief justice must do that then it's a violation of the Constitution, which the president must reject. She basically implied that some judges are biased to President Zuma. which is [to] spit in the face of the justice system," he said.
