I turned 30 recently and I'm feeing all kinds of empowered, sensual and liberated. This has been a gradual - often very painful and tumultuous - journey up to this point. Very early on I committed to searching, to working on myself and to being a conscious participant of my life. The significance of age seemed to me a pivotal juncture and celebrating yet another birthday always gives me reasons to be still, to remember, and to celebrate life in gratitude. In looking back at the path a number of things came to mind with regards to what I've learned and come to hold as true. I remembered that exactly a year earlier I had noted some of those learnings in a short gratitude post I wrote after my younger brother Solomzi returned from ukoluka (the rite of passage of becoming a man). The list below started with remembering those and quickly I arrived at a list of 101 things my twenties taught me. This was a reflection exercise: to take stock, shake things off, and refocus before the next decade. Witnessing the nascent view from where I now stand is healing in many ways. I found that it spoke to both my 20-year-old self as well as the 30 year old I'm getting acquainted with. I share it because I want to and because part of my personal creed moving forward is to live openly and honestly; not to hold back on who I am based on fears that are usually founded on what the 'world' or other people might think; and because I believe that when you learn, you should teach. Here are 101 things my 20s taught me: I'm an ever evolving being and know that this list will continue to change and grow. For now, here's to the dirty thirties. ;)
