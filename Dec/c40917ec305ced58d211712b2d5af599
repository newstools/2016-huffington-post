Ntandoyenkosi Kunene (23) was crowned Miss SA 2016 in May this year and began her journey to the highest level of pageantry on the planet - the Miss World pageant. Here, Kunene, who is a teacher by profession and currently working towards her Honours degree in education, would be competing against 115 finalists from around the world for the title of Miss World 2016. While Kunene did not make it into the top 20 finalists, she championed South Africa at every step on her road to the USA, the host country of this year's event, from her choice of designer to her introductory video,which opens with her speaking in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria, to her announcement of South African designer J.J. Schoeman as the man behind her wardrobe for the 66th annual pageant. Schoeman created the traditional outfit that she wore for the talent section of the competition, an outfit inspired by her home province, Mpumalanga.   And suddenly the first step to new begins is knowing and trusting that everyday is a new start. When the sun rises I thrive to achieve... Inspired by the province of the rising sun, my home province Mpumalanga in South Africa Thank you @jj_schoeman for your outstanding work.
