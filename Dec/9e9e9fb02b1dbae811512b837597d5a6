COMMENT Babes Wodumo was everywhere in 2016. From dance floors to radio charts, the 23-year-old Durban-born artist had South Africans buzzing with her catchy track, "Wololo". Pumping with the unmistakeable sound of Durban's gqom sound, the track catapulted Babes (real name Bongekile Simelane) into the spotlight. And after riding the wave of her first single, the woman with the body that spawned YouTube dance tutorials and dance floor battles, dropped her debut album, "Gqom Queen Vol. 1", on Wednesday December 7, 2016. Despite a response that was moderate in comparison to the thunderous hype that has followed her everywhere she went for the past few months, the self-proclaimed Queen of Gqom made it just in time for the December party season. I've been waiting a long time to say this... MY ALBUM IS OUT TODAY! in all Music stores #thank you Westink ❤❤❤❤ #wololosongoftheyear @abutirams #MampintshaMustFall He cant monopolize a national key point. Such behavior is unacceptable. @MampintshaNuz #FreeBabesWodumo And Mampintsha's hovering presence in Babes's music was impossible to miss from a single glance at the track list where 14 of the 15 tracks on the album featured the Big Nuz lead singer. Fans who were eagerly anticipating the debut release wasted no time in expressing their dissatisfaction on social media.
