They kept us guessing for months, so when actress Pearl Thusi finally started posting pictures of sports anchor Robert Morawa on her Instagram feed, we all let out a collective "aww".

Thusi, who is currently starring on season two of "Quantico", has been commuting between South Africa and the US to film episodes of the show. The working mum regularly posts images of her 9-year-old daughter Thando, saying how much she misses her, but her homesick posts have started featuring her once-mysterious beau more often.
