Malema 'entrusted with mammoth task of dethroning Mugabe', claims PAC Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) leader Julius Malema has reportedly come under fire following the remarks he made on Thursday that Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe must step down. Malema said this during a memorial service in honour of Cuban leader Fidel Castro who died last week at the age of 90. "Like Castro did, handing over power to his brother, President Mugabe must do the same," Malema said. He added: "We love Robert Mugabe for who he is, although we accept it's time for him to step down." Malema also said that his party was not ashamed of Mugabe's legacy â€” "the legacy of taking land". However, according to New Zimbabwe, Malema's remarks "infuriated" the opposition Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) party. The PAC reportedly claimed in a statement that Malema's attack on Mugabe exposed him "of being the agent of the West as he is carrying their mandate very well". "He [Malema] was instructed to destabilise not only the governing party but the entire country. He is again entrusted with a mammoth task of dethroning the African hero of our liberation, uncle Bob," PAC national spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe was quoted as saying. Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980 when the southern African country attained its independence from Britain. News24
