It is 15 years since Paul Walker and Vin Diesel first starred in "The Fast and the Furious", the film franchise about illegal street racing and heists. In that time, there have been six sequels, two short films and Walker's death in 2013 that left fans and the franchise team devastated. With the release of the "The Fate of the Furious", the eighth installment of the series of films, the cast and crew venture into a "post-Paul Walker existence", where The Rock and Jason Statham take on Vin Diesel as his character is seduced into a life of crime, going rogue and turning on the family. The star-studded cast includes rapper Ludacris, Charlize Theron, Michelle Rodriguez and Helen Mirren. "The Fate of the Furious" is set to be released in cinemas in April 2017.
