Understanding Setswana suddenly became very important on Thursday evening. Arguably South Africa's number one celebrity, Bonang Matheba, dropped a series of tweets in the language causing something of an uproar on the platform, in the slow holiday season. Cue frantic calls and tweets to Setswana-speaking friends to understand what Queen üêù was on about. Thankfully Twitter user @KareinMayo, with the entirely appropriate bio of "retired Twitter investigator", took it upon herself to do something of a public service and translate the tweets. We've checked and it's largely correct. Here's a breakdown in English of Bonang's stream-of-consciousness musings. Now to figure out: what does it all mean? So it turns out Bonang is ranting and saying this person is lying so much and she is willing to whoop their worthless ass with the stick  We congratulate you.. now stop lying love pic.twitter.com/SPYl6dp9ox  You don't have manners/respect/morals.. that's the problem  I've been waiting for you.  We'll teach you how to live/tolerate people ‚ù§Ô∏è

You got lies / you are lying damn! You love lies damn it pic.twitter.com/xkGpLkwXvB As far as we understand, the latter translation is probably the correct one in this instance. Moretlwa can be a peace of shit/worthless/useless person
Or

A thin stick from a crossberry tree to whoop someone with lol.. Needless to say, we're all very grateful for the translation. Now that everyone understands the gist of what she said, Twitter detectives are out to discover who exactly she's talking about. ü§î
