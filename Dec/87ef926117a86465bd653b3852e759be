City of Cape Town staff were still reeling over the death of colleague Steven Otter in a home invasion, with some receiving counselling on Monday. ''It's a huge loss for us, really it is,'' said mayoral committee member for transport Brett Herron of his colleague, who worked on communications and community liaison at the city's Transport for Cape Town (TCT). ''We have been inundated with messages.'' Otter was killed after he and his family were woken by robbers in the house they had recently moved into in Harfield Village. He was stabbed to death and his partner Nathalie and her child survived the ordeal. The 43-year-old Otter, who was a former journalist, was also mourned by friends and colleagues in the media industry. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said there were no new developments in the case.
Details of his funeral and memorial service were not yet known. News24
