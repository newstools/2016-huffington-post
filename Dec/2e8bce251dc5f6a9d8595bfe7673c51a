After making news of her engagement public on Monday, local celebrity Minnie Dlamini has posted another photograph to her Instagram feed showing her in an embrace with her new fiancé. But she's not letting his identity slip. In the shot, where his back is to the camera, we see Minnie with her eyes closed and smiling as she holds on to her man. ❤️ A photo posted by Minnie (@minniedlamini) on Dec 13, 2016 at 7:15am PST  Once she announced her engagement, Dlamini's fans and admirers took to Twitter and Instagram to express their disappointment that the starlet was now spoken for, including roasting ex-boyfriend Itumeleng Khune and artist Cassper Nyovest, who has spoken publicly about his crush on her more than once.   But while the memes and reactions caught Dlamini's attention and had her laughing, it was local choreographer, entertainer and Idols judge Somizi who had the best message for "@casspernyovest and all the men".  @casspernyovest and all the men.
