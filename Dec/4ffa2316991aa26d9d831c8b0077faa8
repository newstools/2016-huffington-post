And boy, did those powerhouse singers deliver the goods. Hudson and Grande were in top form as Motormouth Maybelle and Penny Pingleton singing “Come So Far (Got So Far To Go)” in the ‘60s-set musical. The song acted as the NBC production’s big finale, with all the other stars coming out to take their bows. Hudson spoke to E! News about the duet, saying, “It’s exciting, it’s fun. I’m a fan of [Ariana], so it’s like, we get to sing together — when I found that out I was like, ‘Oh yes, let’s get into it.’ It’s another cool thing I get to add to my list, that’s for sure.” Grande told the outlet how relevant the song’s messaging still is. “The hook says, ‘We’ve come so far, but we’ve got so far to go,’ which is exactly where we’re at right now,” she said. “It’s exactly why we’re supposed to be doing this show right now, cosmically. The world needs to hear it in a fun musical way, it’s a message that we need to get out there.” Fans on Twitter definitely agreed ― they loved the performance.
