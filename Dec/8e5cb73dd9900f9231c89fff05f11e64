Employment has been on the agenda in South Africa for most elections, and this quarter we can be a little more thankful: there has been growth of 0,9 percent in jobs over the last year, with a 1 percent increase in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same period last year. Statistician general Phali Lehohla released these figures on Monday in Pretoria, and is a welcome relief for at least 90,000 people, as this percentage translates to 93,000 jobs being created. Lehohla said the extra jobs in this quarter could be attributed to the increase in budgets for elections and higher education. In the second quarter, unemployment dropped slightly after changes in the definition of the term, which included people who stopped searching for work. Lehohla added during the announcment: "The mining industry has been in the doldrums from 2015, but it is picking up with 2,000 jobs gained." Construction jobs increased by 1,1 percent, while community services jobs increased by 3,1 percent. But in the last quarter, there were job losses. "Manufacturing has shown consistent bleeding of 3,000 jobs." While the transport industry had a decline in income, "gross earnings paid to [other] employees increased by R20,482 million [3,9 percent] ... The increase was mainly due to increases in the business services; community services; trade; manufacturing; electricity; mining and quarrying and construction industries," Stats SA said on it site. Average monthly earnings for all industries in the formal non-agricultural sectors increased by 0,1 percent.
