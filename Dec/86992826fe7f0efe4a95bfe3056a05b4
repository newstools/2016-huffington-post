You'd be forgiven if Bonang Matheba's latest Instagram post leaves you feeling a little jelly. The South African radio and television presenter posted a pic of her Christmas present from rapper boyfriend AKA on Wednesday night: A Gucci Dionysus embroidered shoulder sling bag priced at over $3000. Apparently Queen Bee had showed the item to AKA a while back and he plotted till he could get it for her. The Gucci Dionysus bag is the brand's biggest bag of Fall 2015, and comes in a variety of colours and styles. Aka opted for the red lips and lightening bolt design for Bonang. .....Christmas gifts from my King!! 😩😩😩I'm so spoilt!!.... Love! Obsessed! I remember showing you this months ago....now this?! Wow!! 🙏🏾👌 A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Dec 28, 2016 at 10:22am PST The couple are certainly not afraid of showing off their wealth and success. A few weeks ago, a photographer took a picture of their luxury vehicles parked at Bonang's Bryanston home: the very popular Mercedes-Benz G Wagon (Hers) and blue BMW X6 (His). They're really cementing their power couple image. Let's see if those rumours of a reality show featuring the two become a reality. His and Hers. | @akaworldwide x @bonang_m A photo posted by Low Key Pimpin' 🍉 (@blaq_smith) on Dec 23, 2016 at 11:11pm PST
