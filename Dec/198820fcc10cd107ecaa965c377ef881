South African blogger and model Sarah Langa tied the knot with businessman Jehan Mackay at the weekend in a ceremony attended by a who's-who of Johannesburg's social scene. The couple had their traditional wedding ceremony earlier this year, and Langa was on trend in her traditional dress, but made it (more) official this weekend with two more ceremonies. #SJWedding üíû A photo posted by Zovuyo Zoe Msutwana (@ladyzeem) on Dec 17, 2016 at 1:35am PST   Weddings are just magical!

The couple called it a night after one last dance together.
