The annual Kennedy Center Honors are always a delight for the soul, boasting epic musical performances and heartfelt speeches. Thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama, these evenings have been a treat for the eyes over the last eight years, too. That’s largely because FLOTUS, who has been turning it all the way up these last few months in the White House, never ceases to amaze us with her keen sense of style and on-theme dressing. Take this floor-length, off-the-shoulder Gucci stunner, for example. It’s even got a bow embellishment to symbolize the present she truly is (or, you know, the holiday season in general). The first lady previously showed off her holiday flair last week for an event at the White House, wearing a similar dress with long sleeves and a full skirt that was also beautifully embellished. Its length and lack of sparkle made it just a tad less fancy than this one, but there’s no denying they’re both show-stopping party dresses. President Obama, of course, looked exceptionally dapper in his tuxedo and bow tie, but this home run from FLOTUS is once again the main event. Share this slide:
