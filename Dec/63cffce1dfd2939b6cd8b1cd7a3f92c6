  After keeping him to themselves for a month, South African musicians and new parents Zakes Bantwini and Nandi Madida finally shared the first photographs of their son Shaka Madida who was born on November 22. The newest addition to the Madida family even has his own Instagram account, where we are sure his parents will keep posting photos of him as he grows. New dad Zakes posted the photo of Shaka on Instagram adding a caption indicating that, due to tradition, the couple had to wait until the baby turned one month old before they could share his name or image. "With that said we would like to introduce to the world our beautiful blessing that my wife and I have created out of love Shaka Madida." My Dad wrote cause I'm too young to post : Today marks the first month since our son was born . Because of tradition, respect families and our elders we couldn't share his image and his name before he turned a month. Thank you to everyone For respecting our culture, privacy and decision. With that said we would like to introduce to the world our beautiful blessing that my wife and I have created out of love Shaka Madida (@shakamadida) born 22 November 2016. This young king, my amazing children in general and my wife have inspired me to create new music, celebrate and release Love, light and Music 2 visual album next year as I've been so inspired by my life, my wife and my family. #Themadidas #shakamadida #family #lovelightandmusic2 A photo posted by Shaka Madida (@shakamadida) on Dec 21, 2016 at 10:30pm PST  Shaka's birth has inspired new creativity in Zakes who will be releasing a new album next year.
