Justin Bieber is making a return to South Africa with his "Purpose World Tour" in May 2017 and we the people, cannot wait.  The Biebs recently received four grammy nominations for the 59th ceremony next February. Included in his nominations are two of the biggest awards of the night, Album of the year for "Purpose" and Song of the year for "Love Yourself". Purpose has been Bieber's could be referred to as his crossover album. He's grown from being a teenage pop sensation, to a fully fledged pop artist whose new fans would never have listened to "Baby". Last time Bieber was here, in 2013, his tour ended with a dramatic twist. Just a couple of hours after the concert at FNB stadium, thieves pulled off a Hollywood movie-esque heist. It wasn't until the next day that promoters realised millions were stolen from the venue. It was such a carefully planned sting, someone should have created a drama from it. Oh wait, eTV did. Heist made it to SA screens earlier this year and it was so good, in November it returned for season 2.  The drama clearly didn't keep Bieber away from his South African Beliebers, but we're hoping this time around the tour will be scandal free. Tickets will be on sale this Thursday, December 15 at 9am. Discovery cardholders get exclusive access on Tuesday, December 13. The concerts will be in Johannesburg on 14 May and in Cape Town on 17 May, 2017.
