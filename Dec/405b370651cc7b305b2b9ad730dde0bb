Three-year-old Everlate Chauke was laid on Wednesday in Alexandra. The toddler died in November after heavy rains caused flooding near the Jukskei River, causing it to burst its banks. Everlate was in her father Shadreck's arms when water flooded their shack. Shadreck then climbed a tree with his daughter to avoid the water, but the branch they were on broke and Everlate fell into the river. Her body was recovered on the banks of the river on November 22. DNA tests were used to identify her body.  Video courtesy of News24
