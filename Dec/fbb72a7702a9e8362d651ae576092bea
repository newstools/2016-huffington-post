South Africa managed to bag two 2017 Grammy nominations on Tuesday during the announcement of the 59th annual Grammy Awards nominees. South African a cappella singing group Ladysmith Black Mambazo received a nomination in the category Best World Music Album for "Walking In The Footsteps Of Our Fathers". This marks the group's 17th Grammy Award nomination. Ladysmith Black Mambazo has been awarded the Grammy Award four times; in 1988, for "Shaka Zulu"; in 2004, for "Raise Your Spirit Higher"; in 2009, for "Ilembe" and in 2013, for "Singing For Peace Around The World". South Africa-born fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout received a nomination in the world field for Best Classical Instrumental Solo. Born in South Africa in 1979, Bezuidenhout is one of today's most notable and exciting keyboard artists, equally at home on the fortepiano, harpsichord, and modern piano. He has been nominated for a Grammy twice before. The 59th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony will be held on February 12, 2016 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. James Corden will host the ceremony for the first time. Channel24
