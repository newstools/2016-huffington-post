Like many voters and political experts around the country, Tina Fey has been trying to figure out why Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. Strategists may point to campaign mistakes while others may discuss Clinton’s likability factor, but Fey offered a different point of view entirely. “I promised myself I wouldn’t get up here today and talk about the election, because when I get written up in Breitbart, I want it to be because they’re mad that I’m making an all-female Hitler biopic,” said Fey at the Hollywood Reporter’s annual Women in Entertainment breakfast, in reference to the ultra-conservative website. “But I have to say, I think the real reason that Hillary lost ― and it’s the thing that people are afraid to talk about ― not enough celebrity music videos urging people to vote,” she continued through laughs. “I just think if there had been, like, one more funny rap, or like, another ‘Hamilton’ parody, or something. Just like a little more hustle from Liz Banks and we could’ve taken Michigan.” Fey was at the breakfast to accept the magazine’s Sherry Lansing Leadership Award. David Letterman also interviewed her in this month’s issue, in which she elaborated on her thoughts of an impending Donald Trump presidency. “In a world where the president makes fun of handicapped people and fat people, how do we proceed with dignity?” Fey asked. “I want to tell people, ‘If you do two things this year, watch ‘Idiocracy’ by Mike Judge and read [Nazi filmmaker] Leni Riefenstahl’s 800-page autobiography [Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir] and then call it a year.’” Share this slide:
