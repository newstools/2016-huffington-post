The Gupta family and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are set for battle following a warrant issued for the controversial family to attach property worth R180 000, News24 reported. The publication said the family obtained the warrant to seize property from the party's Braamfontein office for auction. The execution was granted to the Guptas and several of their companies by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Thursday. The order instructed the sheriff's office in Johannesburg to seize "moveable goods" at the EFF's headquarters in Braamfontein in order to cover the Guptas' legal costs relating to an earlier court case involving the party and its leader, Julius Malema. The EFF has been at loggerheads with the Gupta family for some time and earlier this year they took their fight to court. The family however emerged victorious and Judge Willem Louw granted an interdict in favour of the Guptas and their companies against Malema and the EFF. Louw ordered the EFF, Malema and EFF Gauteng spokesperson Ntobeng Ntobeng to stop making threats of violence against the brothers, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, their companies and the latter's employees. The EFF was also ordered to pay the Guptas' legal costs totalling just more than R140,000. The EFF also owes the Guptas a further R38,000 relating to an unsuccessful attempt by the party to appeal Louw's decision. EFF general secretary Godrich Gardee told New24 that the party had never received a "tax bill" and were not aware of the execution order granted to the Guptas. "The court order must be served. The question is, has it been served to the EFF or is it being served to the EFF through the media. Is that how a court order must be served?" asked Gardee.
