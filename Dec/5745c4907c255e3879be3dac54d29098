The SABC board ‚Äî which consists solely of its chairperson, Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe ‚Äî has walked out of Parliament's enquiry into the national broadcaster. They failed to stop MPs from launching an investigation into the SABC board's fitness. An ad hoc committee met on Wednesday morning to receive reports from the auditor-general, public protector and the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa). The SABC delegation was led by Maghuve, group executive for corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng and James Aguma, acting chief executive. The parliamentary committee will deliberate for nine days before making a recommendation to the National Assembly. "After listening to the legal team, and taking advice from legal counsel, we go back to the point we made when we started, that Parliament would not be deterred from its work," said ad hoc committee chair Vincent Smith after a private 30-minute meeting between members. -- Additional reporting by News24 The inquiry begins.
