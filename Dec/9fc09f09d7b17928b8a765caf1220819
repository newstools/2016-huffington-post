Ukip donor Arron Banks has taken the bold step of challenging Cambridge University classicist Mary Beard on her knowledge of Roman history, citing his schoolboy studies and Russell Crowe Hollywood epic Gladiator as his sources. Beard - a professor of classics and a fellow of Newnham College since 1984 who has produced multiple series on Rome for the BBC - is one of Britain’s best-known scholars. The university don clearly felt she had to intervene on Twitter when Banks - the multi-millionaire diamond mine-owning insurance tycoon who has bankrolled Ukip and played a key role in Brexit - started to link the fall of the Roman Empire with troubles affecting the European Union. True the Roman Empire was effectively destroyed by immigration. https://t.co/V7H6zF2K5a @Arron_banks i think you all need to do a bit more reading in Roman history before telling uswhat caused the fall of Rome. Facts guys! @wmarybeard yes sacking Rome nothing to do with the down fall ( eyes to sky ) https://t.co/3QvAAuJGT6 @Mr__XYZ @Arron_banks sorry but you may have strong views but you guys don't know Roman history.  I studied roman history extensively - you don't have a monopoly on history ! https://t.co/7hZH8fZZWE @Arron_banks @Mr__XYZ @Senor_gulicreza @Fraser91A sorry mr banks but this might be a subject on which to listen to experts! Sorry I didn't realise you had a single perfect version of roman history. https://t.co/nmCD2eVLce The Huns pushed the Goths south  to the border of Italy,Rome mishandled the migration crisis, sound familiar, 2 yrs later they sacked Rome. https://t.co/FPWMdeTGHe   @Arron_banks @Mr__XYZ @atomiumlondon hang on.... Well the "experts " I read at school believed the sacking of Rome and the break up was caused by failure to control hordes on the border ! https://t.co/pPSuSmzmg2  @Arron_banks @Mr__XYZ @Senor_gulicreza @Fraser91A just wondering who those experts/books were  Oh crikey , school boy history - my teacher was from Cambridge and taught the classics https://t.co/5QTiT6s2IQ  @Westwood7Mark @Arron_banks @Mr__XYZ @Senor_gulicreza @Fraser91A one powerful modern view is to see creation of series of miniRomes.  Didn't marcellinus say something about savages beyond compare falling down on Rome and destroying the empire ... you would probably know https://t.co/i52LEHUxsk  Why not I regularly visit Rome I love it https://t.co/65FEtkmebx I did enjoy I Claudius on tv but the book was better https://t.co/L0MZJoWq8E I love gladiator always watch it with my son https://t.co/iPmEw3TzHL @hrtbps @Arron_banks @wmarybeard pic.twitter.com/oOw04GeqDo I studied roman history extensively - you don't have a monopoly on history ! pic.twitter.com/lCzTG7z7D9 Roman Empire collapsed because Ludicrus Sextus accidentally read out a scroll in the Senate pic.twitter.com/53Zn3EEyBB  Bloody Professors of Classics at Cambridge University, with their 'facts' and their books that they SELL for MONEY. pic.twitter.com/vovgJF5kdy Beard is a mainstream historian, much like the MSM her ilks days are numbered. @wmarybeard @Arron_banks @Mr__XYZ @Senor_gulicreza @Fraser91A Next week he'll teach Tim Berners-Lee about the internet and define rock and roll to Paul McCartney https://t.co/BwLfkYGEgo That seems to have been lost in all the excitement - i'm sure you know much more about the Roman Empire! & you seem a good sport https://t.co/jWT798ObqU They view history through the prism they want to , it doesn't make it right or wrong. https://t.co/z8hFtl86qL Austrian Far-Right Defeated As Country Hasn’t Suffered Enough ‘Rape And Murder Yet’, Says Ukip Donor
