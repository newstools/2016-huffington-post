Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has been trending for hours on Twitter via a trending topic called #IfMalemaWasPresident. It's clear the biggest expectation people have of party commander-in-chief is land. The trend was started by #TweetGuru (@JustKholii_) with just this one tweet. After that, he tweeted a couple of other tweets with the hashtag, including this one about "7de Laan" being replaced with "Zola 7", gaining over 300 likes and over 300 retweets too. When more people joined, it became all about the return of land to black South Africans, making the ANC and President Jacob Zuma mad, and ending corruption. While many seem to have great dreams about what having Malema as president would be like, others were cynical about his leadership. Here are some of the tweets that got our attention.
