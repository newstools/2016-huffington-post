Nigerian football great Sunday Oliseh has been appointed the coach of Fortuna Sittard in the Netherlands. Oliseh signed an 18-month contract with the side, after leaving his position as head coach of the Nigerian national side, allegedly due to unpaid wages, which has been something of a recurring problem for the country's football association down the years. Welcome @SundayOOliseh to our family!  "With Sunday Oliseh we signed a young and ambitious coach with vision, one players look up to," said the club's new Turkish owner Isitan GÃ¼n in a statement. "We were looking for someone who plays attractive football combining it with the will to win. We think Sunday is the right one for this job." All the best to @SundayOOliseh at Dutch club, Fortuna Sittard.

Good to see an African coach given a chance at management in Europe.  Oliseh had a successful spell as a player in the Eredivisie with AFC Ajax from 1997 to 1999, winning the league once, and the KNVB Cup twice. He also played 54 matches for the Super Eagles of Nigeria, won the Olympic gold medal in 1996, played in two World Cup tournaments (1994 and 1998), and famously stunned Spain in Nantes when we scored the winning goal in a helter-skelter, 2-3 affair.  He'll need to conjour that winning spirit once again at his new side. Fortuna Sittard currently sit third from the bottom in the Eerste Divisie, the Dutch second-tier league.
