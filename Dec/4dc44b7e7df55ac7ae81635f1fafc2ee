“You want me to kiss and tell then, don’t you?” Madonna sighed in the passenger seat next to “Late Late Show” host James Corden, who was waiting to hear what it was like to spend a “night out” or a “night in” with her former friend Michael Jackson. “Did you kiss?” Corden asked. “Of course!” “No!” “Of course!” Plying the pop icon for more details, Corden managed to confirm during his Wednesday night “Carpool Karaoke” segment with the singer that the kissing was of the “tongue in mouth” variety, which obviously left him needing more details. “I mean, baby, I’ve been around,” said Madonna, who, by the way, proved herself surprisingly flexible during her’80s jam session with the late night host through the streets of New York City. She then explained how she loosened up the “shy” Jackson with a glass of chardonnay before leaning in. But those days, it seems, are behind her now that she has four kids back home in London. “My work is rebellious,” and the Vatican has excommunicated her three times from the Church, Madonna told Corden. “But my lifestyle isn’t rebellious. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I don’t party. I’m quite square.” “I go home and I’m Julie Andrews,” Madonna said. Watch the whole segment ― which includes an a cappella rendition of “Don’t Cry For Me, Argentina,” a wardrobe critique and “the first in-car twerk I’ve ever seen” ― above. “Madonna: Rebel Heart Tour” airs Friday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.
