Of course, (Beyoncé) is the poster child for that. Portnow lauds that she is the "poster child for that kind of diversification and for stepping out and doing whatever she feels comfortable to do. It's great to see that fans are open-minded and want to embrace all of that." --------------------------------------------------- As a testament to Lemonade's wide-ranging appeal, Beyoncé is also nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance ("Hold Up"), Best Urban Contemporary Album (Lemonade), Best Rap/Sung Performance ("Freedom" with Kendrick Lamar) and Best Rock Performance ("Don't Hurt Yourself" with Jack White). "I usually don't shout out artists, but if you look at Beyoncé, you see a rock performance, a rap-sung performance, a music film, a video, urban contemporary, song of the year," Portnow says. "That's a very, very broad musical palate to paint on that she's chosen. We applaud artists who have the guts to do that." #GRAMMYs 👑 A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beylite) on Dec 6, 2016 at 2:24pm PST LA Times on the future of The #Grammys @RecordingAcad https://t.co/2HuUkfx6W7 so we're just gonna pretend Purpose and Views are better albums than Anti pic.twitter.com/n1VNfhxtAi Love it or hate it, ANTI is Rihanna's best album to date and one of the best albums of the year. It deserved at least an AOTY nomination. @RecordingAcad You really don't like @rihanna , right? #ANTI is a great album and you barely recognized it! #GRAMMYs
