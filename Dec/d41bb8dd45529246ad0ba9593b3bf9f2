Billionaires had a pretty awesome 2016. The world's 200 wealthiest people made a combined US$237 billion (about R3.24 trillion) this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing their total net worth up to $4.4 trillion. The biggest winner was Warren Buffett, who made a cool US$11.8 billion. He's the world's second richest person, with a net worth of US$74.1 billion, preceded by Bill Gates' first-place-worth of US$91.5 billion.

For context, the world's poorest 3.6 billion people (just under half the world's population) had a net worth of US$1.76 trillion in 2015, according to a study by Oxfam. That's just US$488 per person. It was a big win for the wealthy, despite being such an economically volatile year.

Britain's vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump's shocking U.S. election win saw the billionaires' wealth fluctuate through US$4.8 trillion of daily gains and losses before ending the year on a high note.
