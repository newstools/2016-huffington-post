Western Cape Premier and former Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille has yet again stirred controversy on Twitter. She's not new to causing an uproar on the social media platform, tweeting about everything from education "refugees" to telling poor people how to deal with fee increases at universities and causing general mayhem on the social media site, without her party asking her to explain her comments. But tweeter @___Thabi succinctly put together all the times she got away with tweeting highly controversial things. Here's a thread of tweets she compiled that explains everything I would probably say myself.       The time she said absent fathers (NOT toiletries/corruption/funding/transport/resources) are the root cause of barriers to equal education pic.twitter.com/VrpxIiqloJ  The time she allegedly said she "made" Lindiwe Mazibuko and #ThingHelenMade trended pic.twitter.com/zrPpldB4BX  The time she went at it with Simphiwe Dana, denying professional racism in CT pic.twitter.com/8cdaz5aRbY  The time she did this for votes ðŸ˜© pic.twitter.com/IM2XXUf0RF  The time she defended racial profiling in restaurants pic.twitter.com/e6kJweNAxa  And someone added (in case you need this): @___Thabi can I add to your list of Zille's fuckery? Apartheid and the ANC government are not the same, not even close. pic.twitter.com/NSfsB9NXf4
