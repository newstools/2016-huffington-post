A Fees Must Fall leader, who is apparently the only student countrywide still behind bars following university protests earlier this year, is expected to appear in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday. He is challenging the decision to not give him bail. Bonginkosi Education Khanyile is still in prison guys ðŸ¤•ðŸ˜­ What is the reason everyone else could be released BUT him? #FreeBonginkosiKhanyile  EFF-affiliated Bonginkosi Khanyile has been behind bars since September 27 and faces charges ranging from public violence and illegal gathering, to trespassing and inciting violence. During his last appearance, Magistrate Jackie Jonck refused him bail, saying that although universities were closed, the large support base for Khanyile in court indicated his influence over others. "From the supporters in court, it is clear he still commands influence." She said that the Fees Must Fall matter was still not resolved, with government and students not agreeing on a way forward. This raised the ire of EFF supporters, with one of their leaders, Gazuzu Nduli, calling the magistrate a racist outside the court building. Following the refusal of bail, EFF supporters began chanting and singing loudly and continued as they walked through the court building. News24
