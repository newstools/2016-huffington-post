TV personality Minnie Dlamini broke the hearts of many last week when she revealed on her Instagram page that she had "said yes" to a mystery man and was officially off the market. While many were left mending their hearts, a whole lot more people were left wondering who the lucky guy, who had put a ring on one of the country's sexiest women, was. Sunday Times confirmed on Sunday that her fianc√© is 36-year-old TV producer Quinton Jones, who is described as a "very private" man who is also supportive of her public life.   According to the report, the two were friends for years before becoming lovers. Minnie was quoted as saying: "He has been my best friend for many years and knowing that we are going to be spending the rest of our lives together is a fairytale. "Quinton is very private and is not a fan of the limelight but has always been incredibly supportive of my career." No wedding date seems to have been set as yet though and she told the paper she is still processing the engagement.
