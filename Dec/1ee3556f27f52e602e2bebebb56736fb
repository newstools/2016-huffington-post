Paris played host to the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the first time, featuring long-legged models in elaborate lingerie and performances by Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and The Weeknd. The show, this year held at the city's historic Grand Palais, is a highlight of the fashion calendar and featured 51 models, including Adriana Lima — a Victoria's Secret veteran. This year, the jewel-encrusted Fantasy Bra - another highlight of the show, valued at $3 million (about R42 million) — was worn by model Jasmine Tookes.

Earning one's wings is a rite of passage that makes a model a Victoria's Secret Angel. It's the show's highest honour and is usually given to models who have had much experience with the brand.

The move caused some backlash from disgruntled fans of the brand, who took to Twitter to express their disappointment at the decision.
