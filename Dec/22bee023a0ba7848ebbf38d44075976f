As fans of gospel star Sfiso Ncwane come to terms with his death, residents of the Malamulele Hlanganani Old Age Home, who benefited from his generosity, have joined in the chorus of remembrance. One of the home's board members, Agnes Mabasa, said Ncwane's death had come as a shock to them. They were planning to present traditional attire to Ncwane and his wife as a token of appreciation. This was after the musician donated groceries worth R5 000 to the home on August 5. "We are so shocked by the passing of Sfiso. We were in the process of finishing his traditional attire.

Together with his wife, Sfiso was a loving and generous person. He was a good Samaritan, because he came at the time when we never had food as a centre," she recalled. One resident, Syphra Rangani, said she was struggling to come to terms with his death. "I'm so shocked and can't believe that he is no more." Rangani remembered his kindness and said Ncwane had bought them cornflakes. He had told them that grannies also had to eat a decent breakfast. The gospel artist died of kidney failure at a private hospital in Fourways, Johannesburg, on Monday morning. He was 37.
