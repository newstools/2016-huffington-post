Two of Cape Town's three main train lines are back up and running after three days of around the clock repair work to Metrorail's vandalised equipment that wreaked havoc on the service. Regional spokesperson Riana Scott on Wednesday confirmed that while delays of between 20 and 40 minutes were still being experienced, it's northern and central lines were running. Technicians were still on site to run further tests. These high density corridors were prioritised during repairs as they serviced the largest number of commuters. "The service is running better than [on Tuesday]," she said. Metrorail was optimistic that repairs could be completed by the end of Wednesday. The southern line, which runs from Cape Town to Simon's Town, continues to run on the shuttle service introduced on Tuesday. Operations were disabled on Sunday after cable thieves hit one of the company's communications nerve centres on Saturday, rendering controllers unable to see where the trains were on the lines. On Monday, a limited service was running as repair work continued. By Tuesday, the train shuttle system was introduced. It bypassed the most severely affected stations, such as Salt River, and moved from one station to another, with commuters changing trains to get to their destinations. Scott appealed to the public to report those behind the equipment thefts and urged scrap dealers not to accept goods without knowing where it came from.
