Singer/Songwriter and TV presenter Nandi Madida has given birth, according to Destiny magazine. Madida is featured on the cover of the magazine's December 2016 issue. In August, Madida who is married to musician Zakes Bantwini (Zakhele Madida), revealed her pregnancy on the runway at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week where she debuted her first collection from her fashion label Colour in collaboration with designer Inga Madyiba. Madida walked in the show and swung the drapes of her dress back to reveal her baby bump. In an earlier interview with Destiny magazine, Madida said she was thrilled to be having her baby with the love of her life: "Honestly, it's like a dream come true and also to have a child with someone you really love... My husband is amazing" she told the magazine.  It's been an incredible year❤️! My mom and hubby made it so special yesterday(& I know my mom has replaced me with him😂). But tomorrow I will show you photos of the full collection to order from colourclothingline.com @colourfashionlabel.

Amongst the guests were her day ones Noni Gasa, Nomachule (Norma) Mngoma - wife of Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba - and Zakithi Methembu. What a surprise! My day 1's! Known these amazing people and their families since we were kids in Durban. And no matter what happens, what we go through in life.. Our ups and downs. We will ALWAYS be family. @minniedlamini @nonigasa @mablerh @zakithi_mthembu 💙 #babymadida #madidababy #babyshower A photo posted by nandi_madida (@nandi_madida) on Nov 19, 2016 at 9:50pm PST I've known you since I was 7years old and I cannot believe you are about to be a MOM!!!
