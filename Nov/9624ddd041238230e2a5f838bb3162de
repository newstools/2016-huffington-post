The latest video is no different. Shot for the track The One Moment, it compresses a mind-boggling number of colourful explosions into a four and a half second shoot. Unlike many of their previous projects, this one couldn't fit all the crazy into one shot. It totally still rocks.  The song is a celebration and a prayer for those moments when we feel most alive, the band said in a statement on their website. The video is an attempt to represent such a moment literally â€” short, fleeting, and crammed with hundreds of little details. "Humans are not equipped to understand our own temporariness; It will never stop being deeply beautiful, deeply confusing, and deeply sad that our lives and our world are so fleeting. We have only these few moments. Luckily, among them there are a few that really matter, and it's our job to find them," they said. The video was shot by using very precise digital triggers to set off several hundred events in extremely quick succession. The triggers also set off cameras mounted on high-speed robotic arms to capture all of the chaotic magic. The video captures in total, 318 events which include 54 coloured salt bursts, 23 exploding paint buckets and 128 gold water balloons. OK Go's previous incredible stunts include this simply unbelievable video shot in a plane that was literally falling out of the sky:  And this indescribable music-making car-contraption set up:  It must be nice to be a rock star, hey.
