Problematic shock jock Gareth Cliff faced the full wrath of South Africans on Twitter on Sunday after the Sunday Times newspaper carried a story claiming he had admitted in his new book he had handed his former Idols colleague Mara Louw a drink laced with vodka. South Africans on Twitter promptly let their feelings be known: Esethu Hasane tweeted: Gareth Cliff admits in this artichoke that she spiked Mara Louw's drink that got her drunk and fired from IdolSA. How cruel can you be ? pic.twitter.com/g8HUCYsZyO  Other users also did not hold back:  Gareth Cliff is a snake üêç a whole damn snake üêç Gareth Cliff has beeeeeeen hot garbage Wow, so Gareth Cliff spiked Mara Louw's drink to get her fired and he got away with it? White privilege + men are trash combo = Disgusting!  And some took a more philosophical outlook:  This Gareth Cliff/Mara Louw revelation is kinda a metaphor for the South Africa story...  Another user tweeted this little nugget from 2010:  i'm screaming. this is from 2010 when the incident happened. pic.twitter.com/iQFXccaZ53  Or are we all being played as suggested by writer Tom Eaton and it's just a ploy to promote his book?
