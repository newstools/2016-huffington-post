Politics, the future of the country, land redistribution, gender and racism: these were just some of the topics tackled at the HuffPost SA's launch party at Katy's Palace in Johannesburg on Sunday afternoon. Over 200 guests enjoyed a Sunday roast while listening to various speakers, overlooking panoramic views across Johannesburg. Talkshow host and radio presenter Anele Mdoda was the MC for the afternoon. HuffPost SA editor-in-chief Verashni Pillay moderated a panel with Economic Freedom Fighters spokesperson and Member of Parliament Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, Democratic Alliance spokesperson and MP Phumzile Van Damme, and comedian, political commentator and SA's favourite puppet Chester Missing. Home affairs spokesperson and ANC member Mayihlome Tshwete, who was also meant to have been on the panel, had a flight delay and did not make it to the event. Former finance minister Trevor Manuel delivered a hard-hitting keynote address and took questions from the audience. Listen to his speech here.
