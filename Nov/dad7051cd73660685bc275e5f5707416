The ANC Youth League in the Western Cape has distanced itself from a social media post about a "memorial" lecture on President Jacob Zuma. "Earlier today the provincial leadership of the ANC Youth League [ANCYL] Western Cape learnt through social media of an unaccounted for poster indicating that we will be hosting a 'memorial' lecture on ANC president comrade Jacob Zuma," spokesperson Siyabulela Tom said. The lecture was to be delivered by Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association national chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe on Saturday, 3 December, in Gugulethu. "We have no knowledge of such an event organised by the ANCYL Western Cape. The ANCYL would like to inform young people of the province that president Zuma is very much alive and present. The office of comrade Kebby Maphatsoe has informed us that comrade Kebby is not aware nor has he been invited to such an event." The poster circulated on social media overnight.  Tom cautioned activists against misusing the name of the ANCYL in the province and the names of party leaders. Having cautioned against such conduct Tom, however, indicated that they were inspired by the level of creativity shown by the activists in the province. "It is through energy, creativity, proactive thinking and a passion for the ANC even during challenging times that vibrant ANCYL structures can be built. We encourage our activists to utilise our organisational channels to submit their ideas for ANCYL programmes at branch, zonal, sub-regional, regional and provincial level," he said. Tom indicated that the structure was working towards an ANCYL programme to be addressed by Zuma, the president of the ANC Women's League Bathabile Dlamini, the president of the ANCYL Collen Maine and Maphatsoe.
