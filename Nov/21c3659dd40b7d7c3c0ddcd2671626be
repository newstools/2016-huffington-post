Kim Kardashian West teamed up with her sister Khloe to star in the latest Yeezy photoshoot and it is every bit as attention-grabbing as you’d hope. When Kanye unveiled his Yeezy Season 3 collection at New York Fashion Week way back in February, he set the bar high in terms of spectacle. And his wife and sister-in-law ensured the extravaganza continued as they posed in body suits and “destroyed” knitwear for the German bi-annual culture magazine ‘032c’.

The Calabasas compound is the home of the Yeezy studio, which the magazine explains is “a testing site for a new type of uniform, a search for the base unit of clothing”. “THIS IS THE LIMIT,” the photo caption shouts. “The place somewhere outside of some city. This is the dirt of that limit. The pulverized stone crushed into microprocessors. “This is the face of that limit. The scaffolding that holds up a network of desire. “This is the machine of that limit. A nondescript of office designing apparel for the 21st century.” A photo posted by Joerg Koch/ 032c (@032c) on Nov 24, 2016 at 9:23am PST You can get Kim’s “destroyed” sweater for £63.771 and her sleeveless bodysuit for £610.90, both from FarFetch.
