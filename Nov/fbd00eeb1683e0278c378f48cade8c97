Cassper Nyovest's father is retiring after 36 years of teaching and the rapper took to Instagram to pay tribute to his parents. He first posted a photograph of him sitting with himself sitting between his mother and father, captioned "I am a product of love." I'm a product of love.

In 17 days my dad is retiring from teaching after a 36 year long career. I would always ask him as a kid why he wasn't as successful as his students when they would greet him with so much enthusiasm while they drove in their Range Rovers and we were in his Nissan. I didn't understand that some people are meant to make millionaires and not millions and their greatness is in exactly that. One of his most successful students went on to make history and filled up the dome last year besides many other accolades. Today I want to say Dad, you may not have been the richest or the strongest man in the world but your overall the greatest Man I've ever met in my Life. I admire you and I love you very very much. Congrats on a great career and may the good Lord bless you with a restful retirement. From your Son, Refiloe Maele Phoolo.

"I didn't understand that some people are meant to make millionaires and not millions and their greatness is in exactly that. One of his most successful students went on to make history and filled up the dome last year besides many other accolades," he wrote, referring to himself. Nyovest recently drew a crowd large enough to fill the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg. I'm not crying, there's just something in my eye.
