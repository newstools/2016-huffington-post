Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty found herself in the middle of a Twitter storm after providing a hilarious summary of the book Animal Farm, an allegorical novel about a totalitarian state. Her comments came after an Indian examination board announced that English literature classes would now cover Harry Potter, Agatha Christie novels, The Hobbit and novels from the Bengali-language Feluda series. The syllabus for classes III to VIII will also include graphic novels of Asterix, Tintin and American cartoonist Art Spiegelman's Holocaust saga Maus among other books. In an interview, Shetty wholeheartedly supported the move and said, "Books like Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) and Harry Potter as part of the syllabus is a great move because it cultivates imagination and creativity at a young age. They should include books like Little Women, as it encourages respect towards women at a young age. Even a book like Animal Farm can teach the little ones to love and care for animals."   While Shetty's heart was in the right place when she made the comment, the fact that she thought Animal Farm, a 1945 dystopian novella by George Orwell, held up as one of the finest examples of political satire, is children's literature, was enough to immediately draw the blood hounds. 1.   2.   3.    4.   5.   6.
