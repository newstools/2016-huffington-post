He is one of the hottest names on the South African hip-hop scene at the moment, with his debut album climbing charts. At 19-years-old, Nasty C was the youngest recipient of the Best Freshman Award at the 2015 South African Hip-Hop Awards, and nominated for Best Breakthrough at this year's MTV African Music Awards (MAMAs). In May this year he announced that he was due to meet with JayZ's Roc Nation label, but signed with local label, Mabala Noise before the meeting happened, saying that Mabala Noise offered him the deal he "always wanted". After the digital release of the album "Bad Hair" in September, Nasty C announced an extended version "Bad Hair Extensions" to be released in December. The new album features a much-anticipated collaboration with US rapper French Montana. With this move, Nasty C has been likened to rapper Kanye West, who released The Life Of Pablo online and since re-released updated digital versions of the album with no official hard copy release. This new approach to music releases allows the artist to continue "breathing new life" into the album even after it is available to the public.

It opens with the rapper draped in fur before panning to a set that looks like an 18th century period film.
