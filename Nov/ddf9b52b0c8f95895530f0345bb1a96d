Award-winning producer Black Coffee has dropped a teaser for a new track on Instagram and fans can't wait to get a hear more from his new album. The track, featuring Moneoa, will appear on Black Coffee's forthcoming EP, "The Journey", which will be out soon, according to the producer. Count down has begun........" The Journey Continues EP" coming out soon.🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿 A photo posted by Black Coffee (@realblackcoffee) on Nov 22, 2016 at 1:00am PST  The track, which has a laid-back lounge feel, is a departure from the up-tempo dance music Black Coffee has been releasing lately. The clip shows the track being mixed, and the artist's son can be heard in the background asking: "Did you make that song?" Black Coffee is one of South Africa's top producers and exports — and the first South African to ever win a BET Award. He took the prize in the Best International Act Africa category. His EP is a much-anticipated release following the 2015 release of his album also called "Pieces of Me", and the 2015 super-hit "We Dance Again" that sparked a dance challenge on social media.
