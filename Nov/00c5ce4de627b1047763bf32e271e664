A precious video is reminding us that the simplest things in life are often the most beautiful. On Saturday, Taveon Glenn shared a video on Facebook of his newborn daughter getting her hair washed. Baby Amira’s face as she feels the suds and water is pure bliss, and the two and a half minutes are totally mesmerizing. Considering that the video has been viewed over 15 million times, it’s clear others agree. Glenn told The Huffington Post he did not expect the overwhelming response. “I just thought it was a cute video I should show my family and friends,” he said. “I think it went viral because so many people like babies. It touched many hearts and even gave lots of people ‘baby fever,’” he added. Baby fever indeed! Share this slide:
