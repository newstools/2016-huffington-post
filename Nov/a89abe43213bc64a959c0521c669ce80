An alumnus of Wits University, Mazwai has been supportive of the movement. She has shown solidarity via social media and was part of a line-up of musicians who were to perform at a failed Fees Must Fall concert.   Belede is inclusive of nine songs by artists who rebelled by singing songs of protest from South Africa and the rest of the world during a time when the government clamped down on freedom of expression. In addition to covering Mbulu and Semenya, Mazwai included songs by Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba, Busi Mhlongo, Dorothy Masuka and her own song "Ndiyahamba".

As these artists are rebels, so was Mazwai mother which is why she named the album after her. The second single release, "Wakrazulwa" by the late Mhlongo, is her favourite track on the album. When the legend died Mazwai was overcome with such grief, she lost her own voice and didn't want to sing anymore. Mazwai said she needed this particular album to help her trust herself again. A video posted by Maria McCloy (@mariamccloy) on Nov 9, 2016 at 12:25am PST It's not the first time Mazwai uses her music to express her mother's influence in the political sphere. In her debut album Zabalaza, Mazwai pays homage to the stalwarts who gave birth to the liberation of African democracies in "Nizalwa Ngobani?". "The world changes, revolutionaries die and the children forget," she sings. Asking if we have forgotten who our parents are she calls out the names of Belede, Madikizela, Biko, Sobukwe, Sisulu, Mandela and Nkumrah.

The Makeba song Malaika is a tribute to the singing legend and a dedication to Mazwai's 16-year-old daughter who has the same name as the song title. Mazwai will be performing live at her launch concert at the Soweto Theatre on Thursday. Having grown up in the township, she could not imagine hosting this event anywhere else, she has said. "Jikijela" and "Wakrazulwa" are available on iTunes.

Belede will officially be released this Friday, 25 November.
