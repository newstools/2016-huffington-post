The ANC has affirmed that it is standing by President Jacob Zuma, despite calls from within the party for him to resign. Speaking at a press briefing at Luthuli House on Tuesday, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said: "The NEC of the ANC has never voted on any issue. Members persuade one another to a point of consensus on every detail no matter how difficult it may be." The ANC had its National Executive Committee over the weekend, during which Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom delivered a motion of no confidence against Zuma. But Mantashe rejected the term "motion of no confidence". Instead, he said that after a robust and "at times difficult discussion, the NEC did not support calls for the president to step down". #ANCNEC Mantashe: "Introspection is a process, not an event..."

Make of that what you will.   And that's the crux, Mantashe saying: "We affirm him as the president of the ANC and of the country. No Q of support." #ANCNEC @HuffPostNow  Mantashe mentioned the state of capture report released by former public protector Thuli Madonsela in November, emphasising that it was not an ANC matter. He said it was up to individuals named in the report to take it on review, and not the party. Mantashe spoke for an hour and managed to deflect all criticism of President Jacob Zuma. Zuma is currently in Cuba where he will attend the funeral of former head of state Fidel Castro. This story is being updated.
