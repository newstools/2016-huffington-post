Dineo Ranaka's reality show, "Dineo's Diary" has been so successful that she's getting a spin-off. The reality TV star/singer/presenter will be on Mzansi Magic with her whole family on "The Ranakas" come next January. Ranaka posted an image on Instagram celebrating the announcement, saying "What a way to wrap up 2016 and start 2017!" A photo posted by Dineo Ranaka (@dineoranaka) on Nov 23, 2016 at 3:56am PST  "Dineo's Diary" is currently in its fifth season and has been growing since its inception. The controversial reality show, which airs on Vuzu Amp, follows the ups and downs of the Ranaka family, and has won a devoted following. Mzansi Magic said in a release that the new show will be reflective of a modern African family. "Every day the young generation juggle future uncertainty; whilst the older folk try and impose longstanding, at times obsolete, traditions on them," it said.

Ranaka is not just the show's star but also its executive producer.

"It's been an incredible experience working on this production with my amazing, dynamic family. The Ranakas wear their hearts on their sleeves. We are a vibrant family made of strong characters, and I believe that the audience will form personal relationships with each character," Ranaka said in the release. She said fans could look forward to seeing everything from "tests of loyalty, sibling rivalry, love and all its challenges, to joy and sorrow alike". American reality TV star Kim Kardashian West, who was recently featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine, has made built an empire out of her reality TV show,and brought "momager" Kris, her sisters and her brother and his fianc√©e along for the ride too. We can only wonder if Dineo is headed down the same path.
