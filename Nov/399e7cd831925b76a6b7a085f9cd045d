What's it like being a foreigner in South Africa? It depends on who you ask. The experiences of people who come to our country from elsewhere can vary widely. For those from outside the continent, South Africans can often be warm and welcoming. For our fellow Africans from across the continent, though, the experience can be devastating â€” if not deadly. In May 2015, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal saw a spate of deadly attacks against mostly African foreigners. There have been several instances of violence against foreigners between 2008 and 2015, and while South Asian foreigners have been attacked in certain areas, this violence has not affected white foreigners. The attacks have since quietened. Huffington Post SA wanted to find out what life was like for foreign nationals living here since the last violent outbreak, including foreigners from other continents. Watch the video and hear what they had to say.
