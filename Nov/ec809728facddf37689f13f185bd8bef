This week several media reports emerged concerning songstress Zahara's love life, and whether or not lobola had been paid for her. But the last time we looked, lobola negotiations were no one's concern except those family members directly involved in the process. First Channel 24 reported that Zahara was in love and happier than ever now that she's cut down on drinking, shed some weight and is engaged to be married. That's exciting news so everyone was obviously happy for her.  Then while everyone was celebrating with her, Drum magazine accused Zahara of lying about the lobola negotiations to cover up her shame. According to them, Zahara's fianc√©, Umhlobo Wenene FM radio host Amaza Ntshanga, did not pay lobola because he didn't have the money.  But why would you go and rain on someone's parade when they are clearly trying to end the year on a good note? And even if someone was "ashamed" and "embarrassed," who are we to uncover their shame and embarrassment?

Zahara clapped back through Tshisa Live and said she does not discuss her love life and has never discussed her private life with that magazine. She said in the Xhosa culture these processes are not public information.

Whether the lobola was paid or not why was this a thing? Tradition dictates that lobola negotiations are handled discreetly, so why are we sticking our noses in where they clearly don't belong?
