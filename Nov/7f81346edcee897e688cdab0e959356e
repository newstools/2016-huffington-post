Simphiwe Dana is an award-winning South African artist. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is a liberation struggle hero and former wife of the late president Nelson Mandela, who is sometimes dubbed the "Mother of the Nation" despite her precarious history. The two met at Madikizela-Madela's home this week when Dana delivered tickets for her "Simphiwe Dana Symphony Experience" concert. Dana posted a selfie with the political veteran, who recently celebrated her 80th birthday, saying that talking to her "makes you wanna [sic] save the world".

Dana said she had "no words" and that it was "a great honour". She sang the soft, lilting isiXhosa song a cappella, while Madikizela-Mandela listened intently.  Singing Mama Winnie the song I wrote for her. What a great honor! I have no words! 💜👑💜 A video posted by Simphiwe Dana 💜👑💜 (@simphiwedana) on Nov 23, 2016 at 2:34pm PST The "Simphiwe Dana Symphony Experience" will see Dana on stage with a 60-piece orchestra, a choir of 30 and a dance troupe. In partnership with Khaya FM and BET Africa, Dana will be presenting a first-of-its-kind event that will hopefully count Madikizela-Mandela in its audience too.  It's been a few years in the making.
