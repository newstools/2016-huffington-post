HuffPost SA asked South Africans what worries them most about our country. We made a concerted effort to go across Johannesburg, to places with people of different races, backgrounds and economic status. We expected to get different responses from different people. But we what found was quite surprising: almost every single person we spoke to said, in different ways, that what worries them most is corruption. According to the non-profit advocacy group Corruption Watch, from January 2012 to the end of December 2015, 10 573 allegations of corruption were filed with the organisation. This included 2 382 reports of corruption in 2015 alone. Of these, 71 percent fell within their definition of corruption, compared to 56 percent in the previous year. Corruption Watch defines corruption as the abuse of public resources or public power for personal gain. Watch the video above.
