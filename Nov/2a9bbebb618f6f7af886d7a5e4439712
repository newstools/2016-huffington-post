Problematic shock jock Gareth Cliff faced the full wrath of South Africans on Twitter on Sunday after the Sunday Times newspaper carried a story claiming he had admitted in his new book he had handed his former Idols colleague Mara Louw a drink laced with vodka. South Africans on Twitter promptly let their feelings be known: Esethu Hasane tweeted:  Other users also did not hold back:  Gareth Cliff is a snake üêç a whole damn snake üêç  And some took a more philosophical outlook:   Another user tweeted this little nugget from 2010:   Or are we all being played as suggested by writer Tom Eaton and it's just a ploy to promote his book?   Others echoed that sentiment:  This article and headline was amended on Sunday 4 December 2016 following an apology by The Sunday Times acknowledging they incorrectly stated that Cliff admitted pouring Louw a drink spiked with vodka.
