South Africans will never miss an opportunity to poke fun at anyone and right now President Jacob Zuma is the victim. It all started with a tweet by Nomfundo Engler, who posted an old image of Zuma with former Presidents Frederik De Klerk, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki on a red carpet. Engler pointed out that Zuma was not on the red carpet then used the hashtag #PoorBaba. She then pointed out that Zuma was also not wearing a white shirt and grey tie like everyone else and said, "They didn't even give him a white shirt and grey tie! Baba is right to be upset! In fact he must run for a third term!!! #PoorBaba." Soon afterward, other people jumped onto the trend with pictures of Zuma in awkward positions or situations. Here's a collection of some of our favourites. That time they wouldn't let him on the conversation. #PoorBaba pic.twitter.com/Z9ZCxwjQUq Dololo rugby world cup win in his time #PoorBaba pic.twitter.com/DYqkDNIlvV When uBaba logged in and saw #PoorBaba pic.twitter.com/u9k6XRa7yx When Lindiwe Sisulu Kissed Blade but wouldn't kiss Baba  #PoorBaba pic.twitter.com/t7HHou8oc7 The time Zuma was not invited into the group handshake #poorbaba pic.twitter.com/bcS1687vhN That time uTata wouldn't hold his hand. #PoorBaba pic.twitter.com/sRNKsAg0uc The time his neighbors in Nkandla didn't vote for him and they were in the line with him #poorbaba pic.twitter.com/1tY85vzvF9 Madiba pointing #Poorbaba the wrong way so he doesn't see Kanye West behind him ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/dKPM3Pt7IB
