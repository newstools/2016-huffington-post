South Africans will never miss an opportunity to poke fun at anyone and right now President Jacob Zuma is the victim. It all started with a tweet by Nomfundo Engler, who posted an old image of Zuma with former Presidents Frederik De Klerk, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki on a red carpet. Engler pointed out that Zuma was not on the red carpet then used the hashtag #PoorBaba. She then pointed out that Zuma was also not wearing a white shirt and grey tie like everyone else and said, "They didn't even give him a white shirt and grey tie! Baba is right to be upset! In fact he must run for a third term!!! #PoorBaba." Soon afterward, other people jumped onto the trend with pictures of Zuma in awkward positions or situations. Here's a collection of some of our favourites.
