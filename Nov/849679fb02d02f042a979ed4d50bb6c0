Meet Polly the goat. A photo posted by Goats of Anarchy (@goatsofanarchy) on Oct 31, 2016 at 5:59am PDT  She lives in a rescue centre called Goats of Anarchy, run by Leanne Lauricella. According to The Dodo, she's inseparable from her duck suit. "Polly is a baby goat with serious medical issues. She's blind, has neurological problems that affect her eating ability and is severely underweight for her age. She also suffers from anxiety," The Dodo said. She flies into a panic everytime she can't find Lauricella. "She'll find a corner of a wall in the house, and she'll just start sucking on the wall," Lauricella told The Dodo. "So all the corners in our house have these little suck marks from her mouth." Some of yall don't believe me. Polly loves her duck suit. Polly NEEDS her duck suit. It puts her right to sleep. Tonight she was feeling anxious because I'm too busy to sit with her. I put her duck suit on and she's totally happy. It instantly soothes her! Its the strangest cutest thing. This is not abuse, this is love.

Except the suit had the effect of calming Polly down. It seems it has the same calming properties as a swaddling blanket for a baby. She also has pig and fox costumes, but the duck one is definitely her favourite. A video posted by Goats of Anarchy (@goatsofanarchy) on Oct 25, 2016 at 8:40am PDT  I'm not crying, you're crying! Polly still can't decide what she wants to be for Halloween, but she wanted to try dressing like her brother Piney A photo posted by Goats of Anarchy (@goatsofanarchy) on Oct 17, 2016 at 9:51am PDT  Read more at The Dodo, and you definitely need to follow Goats of Anarchy on Instagram.
