If you haven't been paying attention to social media, the #UNameItChallenge is the latest trend to make the rounds online. It features American gospel singer and pastor, Shirley Caesar, enthusiastically singing the lyrics "I got greens, beans, potatoes, tomatoes, lambs, rams, hogs, dogs, chicken, turkeys, rabbits. You name it!" during a sermon.

Over the past few days everyone from Chris Brown to local celeb Khanyi Mbau has produced their own take on the #UNameItChallenge. Even The Daily Show host Trevor Noah and correspondent Roy Wood Jr. added a political spin to it. A video posted by The Daily Show (@thedailyshow) on Nov 21, 2016 at 8:54am PST  We doubt many have watched enough of the original video to know what she was actually preaching about, but they definitely know what she said at minute 5:52. With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the clip was perfectly placed to go viral, especially after a hip-hop track was put under it.

Of course, the South African versions are our favourite but we also really loved this one of a vegan saying they enjoy Thanksgiving too, just without all the meat.
