It seems the tables are turning and some members of the African National Congress (ANC) want President Jacob Zuma out now. The City Press reported on Sunday that Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom stunned Zuma and his backers when he tabled a motion for Zuma to step down at the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting yesterday. The paper said that "those set on removing Zuma were lobbying for a secret ballot to determine the president's fate. A secret ballot could be the nail in Zuma's coffin as it would empower those who fear a backlash." According to the report, this was a move that blindsided the president's backers in the NEC and the meeting was adjourned with the discussion around a vote deferred to today, the last day of the NEC sitting. A pro-Zuma member was quoted as saying that the secret ballot "was not a done deal" and that they wouldn't "let it go without a fight".
