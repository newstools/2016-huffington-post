Two artists are forcing Joburgers to talk about rape through a downtown art exhibition. The installation, titled "SA's Dirty Laundry" includes 3,600 "old and used" pairs of underwear that have been donated to represent the number of people raped every day in South Africa. The installation, by Jenny Nijenhuis and Nondumiso Msimanga, will be on display until December and aligns with the 16 Days of No Violence Against Women and Children. The artwork is based on a 2013 Medical Research Council survey which found that up to 3,600 people could be raped in the country every day. Watch the video above.
