We could have a debate about how much of our current television and movie fare has been recycled from 30 or 40 years ago, but that would prevent us from rewatching this amazing new trailer for the NBC show "Emerald City". Dorothy is all grown up, the witches are proper scary and the scarecrow has no memories but does pack a six-pack. After a grown-up Dorothy and her dog are whisked away by a tornado, not in a clapboard house but in a police squad car, the trailer sets up a conflict between science and magic. The trailer is only two-and-a-half minutes long, but it's evident that this Dorothy will not go skipping down the yellow brick road and is no need of saving from the wizard. Whether the show is more "Game of Thrones" or more "Once Upon A Time", remains to be seen. Watch the trailer here:
