Miley Cyrus and “fairy godmother” Dolly Parton appeared together on Tuesday night’s episode of “The Voice” to deliver a stunning rendition of Parton’s hit “Jolene” with the a cappella group Pentatonix. As soon as the group started, we felt goosebumps. The country singer and the former Disney star took on the first verse while Pentatonix provided a haunting vocal backtrack made up of beautiful harmonies and some beatboxing. From then on, the performance just got better. Pentatonix performed “Jolene” with Parton earlier this year, giving it a hauntingly beautiful update. Cyrus has also performed the hit with Parton and it’s hands-down one of her best backyard sessions. Check out the entire performance above. Share this slide:
