Kanye West was hospitalised for exhaustion in Los Angeles on Monday for and is being held for psychiatric evaluation for his own safety. West was allegedly experiencing temporary psychosis as a result of severe sleep deprivation. It's since been reported that the 39-year-old rapper, who has previously spoken about his battle with depression, is allegedly being treated for a mental illness.

But Lady Gaga has come to West's defense, tweeting that mental illness is not to be joked and calling for more compassion for Kanye. South African actress Nomzamo Mbatha, joined other celebrities tweeting in support of the rapper, and pointed out that West has not been the same since his mother passed away in 2007. After a series of public rants last week, West cancelled the remainder of his Saint Pablo tour before being hospitalised this week.
